‚Äî

All in all, I think Anthony Edwards' season is pretty properly rated.

He did what I (and most people?) expected he'd do. He joined a bad team, was given the freedom to play his game, and produced very reasonably given his play style, draft position, talent level, and opportunities. In fact, I'd say he had one of the most ""that seems about right"" rookie seasons in recent memory:

* Expectation: he's the first overall pick, he'll get good run. Reality: 32 minutes per game - check.
* Expectation: he's a very talented scorer, will probably take some time to learn how to pick his spots, but he'll produce points even if it's slightly inefficient. Reality: 19 points per game, 42% from the field, 33% from 3 - check.
* Expectation: he's athletic enough to affect the game from a rebounding and defense standpoint, but still young and on a losing team so it'll be very inconsistent. Reality: check.
* Expectation: he'll have incredibly exciting moments (dunk on Yuta Watanabe üò±), but he's not really going to be a franchise-changing player from a wins/losses standpoint anytime soon, the advanced stats are going to be¬†*ugly*. Reality: check.
* etc.

Even if some of these sound like backhand compliments, they're not meant to be negative. Ant was 19 years old - at that age you just want to see flashes, and we saw the flashes.

I think his future is bright; there's no reason his developmental curve as a scorer can't be one like that of Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Devin Booker, etc. And he definitely has the potential to eventually add a playmaking and defensive element to his game that would take it to the next level.

Your question does bring up a much more interesting topic though, which I do want to touch on:¬†**how different the difficulty levels are for different types of rookies to adjust to the NBA.**

Players like Anthony Edwards - namely, talented scoring guards / wings with above average athleticism coming in on bad teams - have it relatively easy, for a few reasons:

1. Scoring the ball is the ""simplest"" thing to do if you can do it (to clarify, I'm not saying scoring points is easy in the NBA; I'm saying if you're already good at scoring, it comes naturally and your role is simple - just go out there and get buckets)
2. The expectations are relatively low because there's no real urgency for the team to win, so you'll be given a lot of opportunity and freedom to find your game, be a volume shooter, make mistakes, etc.
3. Similarly, because you're a rookie on a losing team, rarely is an opponent going to prepare for you and play you like it's a meaningful game
4. Other than having to face professional defenders being more athletic and teams sporadically mixing in a few schemes here and there, there's not a materially bigger challenge to score in the NBA than in college overall in the¬†*regular season*. In fact, it may feel easier for guys like Ant Edwards because they suddenly have more space and are playing with far more talented teammates than they've ever had in their lives, and aren‚Äôt getting box-and-1-ed all the damn time

What I'm trying to get at is: as an athletic and skilled scoring guard, your role on the court doesn't change much from college to your first season in the NBA. Your main responsibility is to put up points, and a step back jumper is still a step back jumper, a euro step is still a euro step - all that stuff translates over regardless of level or league.

For similar reasons, skills like on-ball defense and rebounding also translate over fairly straightforwardly. If that's what you made your name off of in college, chances are you'll still be pretty good at it from day 1 in the NBA.

Now for some stuff that's more difficult:

1. Scoring (if you're not athletically superior) - this is why smaller scoring guards who put up big numbers in college often come in struggling mightily (e.g. Austin Rivers, Jimmer Fredette, Trey Burke, Trae Young)
2. Playmaking - you have to adjust to the different pace of game, a different style of play, get used to your new teammates, learn the entire playbook, etc.
3. Off-ball defense, particularly if you're a young big man - no exaggeration, it's literally like a learning how to play an entirely different sport (this is by far the most difficult transition)

All of those things take time and reps. Adding new skills, developing current skills, learning about your opponents and your teammates - there are no shortcuts to getting over them.

That's why it's important when judging young players to understand what their skillsets/roles are. Ant Edwards coming in averaging 19/5/3 right off the bat is great - but it's not mind blowing. James Wiseman's first season was a disappointment to many; they'll point to his mediocre stats (11 &amp; 6) and the fact that the Golden State Warriors started winning as soon as he went down with an injury and Draymond Green took over as the team's small-ball center. But once you take in the fact that Wiseman's transition was orders of magnitude more difficult (both offensively and defensively) than most and that he did noticeably improve at many small things (defensive rotations were tighter, decisions with the basketball better, etc.) game to game, I don't think it's a stretch to say his rookie year was almost just as much of a success.

Luka Doncic came in polished as hell and was clearly a franchise player from day 1; Trae Young's first few months had him on pace to be one of the worst players in NBA history. And sure, Luka is still obviously the better player in my opinion in 2021, but Trae has proven he‚Äôs certainly no bust.

Only time will tell how rookies' careers turn out. Probably not wise to jump to conclusions and overrate or underrate them after one season.","OC: Rookies Adjusting To The NBA (easier for some, harder for others)"

68,nba,"The Celtics looks ready to break out in 2021-2022 season and perhaps make another serious run like they did in the Bubble. 

Schroder, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Horford \[STARTERS\]

that lineup should scare anyone in the East including the Nets and Bucks. The ceiling for Brown/Tatum has not been reached yet, there is a chance that an MVP could be around the corner for one of them \[likely Tatum\]. 

Might Schroder be a better FIT for this team than Kemba Walker was?? The offensive production will not be dropped off much \[and to be honest you want LESS offense from the PG slot and more from the JAYS duo\] 

But the DEFENSE of Schroder/Smart combo could be deadly and the Defensive Minded Ime Udoka \[the Ubuntu believing first EVER African head coach\] with the Front Office being run by the Beautiful Mind of Brad Stevens....could this be the formula for the Celtics??

Might Boston be the ""surprise"" of the season and with Tatum ready to make the LEAP into the top 5 players in the NBA with something like 32/9/6 stats line could they finally be ready??

Is the 18th Championship coming to put Boston ahead of the LA Lakers? 

The Nets, Bucks, Heat and Sixers \[if they land Fox or Dame\] will be great challenges to the Boston Celtics but are they actually good enough to beat this new DEFENSE built by Stevens/Udoka? Not to mention the breaking out of Tatum last 2 seasons + Olympics where only Durant was better. Is Tatum ready to pass Durant? I think so, but only time will tell if it happens THIS year.",Dennis Schroder finished in the top 10 in midrange shooting percentage the last 2 seasons and has played excellent defense. Could his impact on the Celtics [either as starter or 6th man] push them back into the Top Seed in East with an excellent defensive coach Ime Udoka and the Jays Duo Blossoming?

80,nba,"I'm more meaning, which two players that played at the same time or overlapped would have made the best hypothetical duo ever in your opinion? 

For example, Wade and Kobe were both scorching hot during the '05-'06 season and so I could say the hypothetical 2005-2006 Kobe/ Wade backcourt would've been the best. I don't know if I believe that, but it works for an example. 

If I had to actually pick, I think I would go with an obvious one in Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1992-1993 season. 

Hakeem Olajuwon: 26.1/13.0/3.5 &amp; 4.2 BLK on 52.9/0/77.9 in 82 GP

Michael Jordan: 32.6/ 6.7/ 5.5 &amp; 2.8 STL on 49.5/35.2/83.7 in 78 GP

Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon would have been the Kobe/ Shaq duo but 10x the defense. To have the top two offensive AND defensive players of all time play during the same era is crazy, let alone imagining them playing together. 

Would any duo have been able to beat this? 1961-1962 Bill Russell/ Wilt Chamberlain frontcourt is tough. 50 PPG Chamberlain and 24 RPG/ 8 BLK Russell.",What is the best NBA duo that never happened?

They again TELL him to apologize the next morning, meaning they‚Äôre fully saying it‚Äôs his fault and he‚Äôs not happy about that. They suspend him one game 




KD blames FO cause they acted like it didn‚Äôt happen, didn‚Äôt even try to make both of them sit together and talk it out or at least bring in Steph to be in the middle. Now KD probably feels awkward about dray getting suspended instead of resolving the issue between them. KD decides to peace out to avoid situations like this to happen

As a player, he definitely deserved at least one max contract throughout his career. He was one of the best passers in the game and was a constant triple-double threat (back when triple-doubles were a big deal).

He was the Lakers' X-factor in their 2020 Championship run (also had the most assists in a single postseason since 1971). Despite his flaws as a player, he was still much better than some of the players today getting $20M+ a year.

165,nba,"Pick a player from the East and one from the West that can make their first Allstars appearance this year. If you want this to be a challenge pick someone who isn't a guard.

In the west you have a lot of perrenial almost Allstars, like CJ, DeAaron, Jamal (who is injured) even Big Government Reggie if he can keep up the shooting from these past playoffs, Nurkic if he could stay healthy for at least the first half of the season.
You also have a mix of ascending players like Ja, Anthony Edward's, Ayton etc

The Safest pick would probably be Ja Morant,
If it can't be a guard I'd pick Ayton as he improved alot last season.

The East is going to be interesting this year as it seems very top heavy and I expect like 3-4 teams to take the majority of the all-star roster this year. And some teams will be a mystery as to how well they will be with their new coaches such as indy, Washington, celtics. Its rare that an NBA player makes the Allstars team as a rookie and I dont think Cade or any of his other draft mates will be named.

215,nba,"I just woke up from a nap and had a dream about Cade Cunningham. I have to share before I forget. 

I was in the tunnel before what was clearly a big game. The lights were down in the arena and music was blaring. 

In the distance I see Cade is his blue warmup on the court, and he‚Äôs just dancing. So carefree and happy. Just dancing and getting hype. 

From the tunnel I raise my hand up and throw my pointer finger in the air as to signify ‚Äúhey No. 1 pick,‚Äù just hoping he acknowledges me back. 

To my surprise and awe, Cade not only sees me but he starts dancing towards me, coming closer with every shuffle. 

Suddenly I realize my two young boys are with me. My youngest, on my shoulders, knows Cade and he knows him. Cade is excited to see him and tussles his hair like they‚Äôve been old buddies.

I say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up Cade,‚Äù and he daps me up and gives me love like an old friend. I‚Äôm honored that he knows me. I‚Äôm honored that I‚Äôm this moment he took time to be with me. 

Cade leads us back to the court and we sit down and start watching the small monitor the announcing crew has in front of them. Instead of the game, though, it‚Äôs that scene from the Lion King where Simba is lifted up into the air for the whole kingdom to see and ‚ÄúThe Circle of Life‚Äù plays as the soundtrack.

I wake up and realize that I‚Äôm weeping. I‚Äôm crying tears of joy because I‚Äôve been shown the truth. 

Cade is the chosen one. He is the King.

Full Quote:

&gt; I obviously see the excitement of it. If we would have lost two games, we wouldn‚Äôt have been in the playoffs at all. And that‚Äôs, that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow. When you‚Äôve been in the top eight for the entire season. You never dropped out of the playoff position. But yet, you know, you can lose two games, and that‚Äôs what happened to Golden State, they were at the eighth spot, and then they ended up losing to us and then to Memphis and they didn‚Äôt make it in the playoffs. I could see where it‚Äôs kind of fun for one game, but I don‚Äôt want to diminish what happens in the regular season. 

&gt;They like to say that it combats tanking and I think tanking would be best served by losing draft picks, something that hurts the basketball department as opposed to a financial punishment, right? Because the general manager‚Äôs job is based on wins and losses. The general manager‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt based on how many season tickets you sell, or how many sponsors.


Also she cites the Washington Football Team as the reason she quit fantasy football:

&gt; I could no longer say the Washington football name. It just rubbed me the wrong way. So I stopped playing a long time ago, many years ago ‚Ä¶ But like, I couldn‚Äôt say it in the draft and so one season, I would refuse to draft players from that team. So then I wouldn‚Äôt have to use the word because it offended me. And that comes from my relationship with Phil Jackson and his relationship and honoring of the Native Americans. Some people felt like they didn‚Äôt have to change the name (the team changed to ‚ÄúWashington Football Team‚Äù in 2020), but to me as a person in my position, if just one person‚Äôs feelings are hurt from the nickname, then why have it? It‚Äôs supposed to bring joy to people, not to demean people. And one year, I refused to draft players from the Washington team. And then I thought, why am I punishing the players (and stopped altogether).","[Kaplan] Jeanie Buss on Play-ins ""I could see where it‚Äôs kind of fun for one game, but I don‚Äôt want to diminish what happens in the regular season.

244,nba,"It should go without saying most of the answers should be players who've played at least a season in the NBA. Rookies are still adjusting. The only red flag would be if a rookie was flat out lazy and looked disinterested while he was on the court. 

On the other hand, players who've played in the NBA should find summer league to be a considerable step down from the NBA.

My personal selections:


* Grant Riller. He struggled to facilitate and playmake all summer league. They had to switch James Bouknight from off ball to on-ball guard because Riller just wasn't getting the ball to him. It was very disappointing considering he also spent four years in college before his rookie year. But he was on a two way contract during his rookie year which limited his learning opportunities. 

* Zeke Nnaji. I was really high on Zeke after he showed potential as a stretch big last season but he was quickly overshadowed by Bol Bol and seemed to struggle with placement and physicality. He was pretty much buried on the bench last year, though. 


* Cole Anthony. He couldn't hit a shot and he didn't know how to play with Jalen or RJ on the court. This was especially surprising because he started most of his games last season.  He had several sloppy turnovers and lost his balance a few times.",Who were the most disappointing summer league performers for you this year?

In regards to defense the argument is generally that defense being less physical compared to the past would make it easier for pretty much any player on the offensive end.

279,nba,"I don‚Äôt wanna rail on the kid too much, but Jarrett Culver might be one of the biggest busts in modern history. 

2 seasons in after being picked #6, he was just traded for Patrick Beverley on a team (Memphis) who just gave up a young shooting guard (Grayson Allen) to settle out their logjam at the position.

He‚Äôs proven to be a very poor shooter shooting around 50% from the line, 40% from the field, and 28% from 3 as a *shooting guard*. He also shoots 45% at the rim. 

He‚Äôs been the Timberwolves worst player for 2 straight seasons. His role was relegated to a benchwarmer when the Wolves hired Finch mid-season on a team that was long eliminated from playoff contention and main focus was playing *young players*.

Only 4 top 7 picks since 2014 didn‚Äôt play atleast more than 2 years with their drafted team. 

- Buddy Hield, who was traded for an all star

- Kris Dunn, who was also traded for an all star

- Josh Jackson who wasn‚Äôt necessarily traded for basketball reasons although his play was outweighed by personal issues
 
- Markelle Fultz, still arguably a bust but still miles better than Culver.

His saving grace is that he was a solid defender this year in limited minutes but his offensive play outweighs his defense in every shape or form. I‚Äôll be surprised if he even plays in Memphis.",Is Jarrett Culver one of the biggest busts in modern NBA history?

282,nba,"If the Nets had remained healthy this year and dominated their way to a championship, I have to admit I probably would have put an asterisk on the team (and Durant's name) simply because it was so completely stacked in comparison to anyone else, thereby reducing the level of competition. 

The upcoming year is very unusual though, because we now have two super duper teams (as both have 2-3 super stars and overall, potentially, 4-5 HoF's). To my mind, then, if they end up facing each other in the Finals--while remaining healthy--that is a completely fair match. Whoever the winner might be in that scenario will have faced stiff, tough competition and would thus deserve 100% credit without any asterisk.

But I'm curious what others think and I'm open to other views...

Side note: It's true I'm a Thunder fan, but I would say this about any super duper teams.","If two healthy super (duper) teams, such as next year's Lakers and Nets, face each other in the Finals, nobody should put an asterisk by the name of any of the winners since it's a fair and challenging match for both sides."
283,nba,"Basically in every playoff match up besides Philly (unlikely to happen) and the Nuggets (maybe not contending next year unless Murray is 100% already) it seems clear that they intend to close with AD at the 5 + Lebron + Russ.

That leaves 2 spots open for pretty flawed or unproven players :

\- THT, who has tons of potential and a crazy wingspan, but isn't quite there yet as a defender or as a shooter.

\- Ariza, who was a really good 3&amp;D option a few years back but looked quite outmatched last year in the playoffs and is now 36

\- Melo, who is a really good shooter at this point, can still provide some iso scoring, but is also a pretty terrible match up against teams with elite quick guard who could just pick and roll him to death

\- Ellington, elite shooter, and maybe not as bad defensively as some may think but still pretty limited and not versatile (cannot really guard multiple positons)

\- Nunn who might be the best player of the bunch, but still lack size and is average at best on defense

\- Monk, who has one year of elite shooting, seems like a good fit with the rest as an elite athlete but is completly unproven and another one positon defender

\- Bazemore, probably the best theorical fit, but who's a bit unreliable at both as a shooter (he's not really getting guarded on the perimeter and has inconsistent % from year to year) and as defender (he tries hard, but has limited size and fouls way too much)

&amp;#x200B;

IMO if one of the 3 young guys step up and is reliable on both ends, they'll be completly fine, but if they have to rely on 2 of the vets to be in those 2 spots they could be in trouble",What do you expect the Lakers closing 5 to be ?

Takeaways:

That 1984 draft was insane! Jordan, Barkley, Hakeem, and Stockton all in one draft.  I'd always heard 2000 was the worst draft and it comes in above only the two most recent drafts in the dataset (sure to pass it by the time those players' careers are over) and 1973.  Looking at 1973 its a guy better know as a coach at the top (Doug Collins) and the only other two names I know are George McGinnis and the guy famous for almost killing Rudy Tomjanovich.

For some reason I thought 2003 would be higher but I guess there weren't many good players in the lottery outside the top 4.

I need to be honest, I should brush up on my NBA history because I don't know who a lot of these dudes are.  Interesting that Joe Bryant is a bog-standard 14th pick while his son went on to be the best 13th pick of all time. (Arguably, by win shares Karl Malone is actually significantly ahead of Kobe)

And hey, there's Kermit Washington again repping the 5th pic! This is the most exposure that guys had in years and he didn't even have to almost kill a dude.

Michael Redd, coming off a curl, doesn‚Äôt have much daylight. Durant is covered, but only by one player, but KD looks confused. Drummond though, surprisingly, is running towards Lebron.

349,nba,"Post All-Star break Ant averaged 24/5/3 in 36 games, what do you see him averaging in his sophomore season?",Anthony Edwards 2020-21 Rookie Highlights
350,nba,"Over the last few years, we have seen 2 absolutely amazing player-development stories:
1. Giannis - drafted 15th by the Bucks in 2013, and slowly and methodically developed into a 5-time All-Star, 2-time MVP and NBA Champion
2. Jokic - drafted 41st by the Nuggets in 2014, and is now a 3-time All-Star and the reigning league MVP

Amazing development stories. But here‚Äôs a question - what if these guys had not been drafted by their respective teams? 

For the greatest among the already exclusive group of generationally talented players - think Jordan, LeBron, KD - I think we can all agree that they would have had solid success regardless of where they might have landed, give or take a bit. LeBron landed in Cleveland of all places, and has the career he‚Äôs had.

But what about others? The Hall of Famers or future HOFers who landed in the right spot at the right time? Or the ones who didn‚Äôt?

We want to believe that if you have talent and work hard, you‚Äôll be successful. However, because of that, I think we often tend to forget the impact that the franchise, and it‚Äôs focus on development of players at the time, have. Some examples:
The LA Lakers and their batch of young guys: Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, DeAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball. They were all plateauing with the Lakers, because at that time, the Lakers just weren‚Äôt that into player development. Since leaving the Lakers, these 5 players consist of 2 Most Improved Player winners, 1 Sixth Man of the Year Winner, and 2 starting caliber point guards.
The Spurs and the way they built up Kawhi Leonard is one of the most impressive slow burns to greatness ever. The guy had played 3 seasons (and almost 200 games), before he had a season where he averaged more than 13 points in a game. They had patience with this kid who had the defensive chops, but had the potential for so much more. They could have just let him be a defensive role player. The NBA landscape would have been very different if they had.
The Raptors are churning out high caliber players from late first rounders, second rounders and even undrafted guys (Pascal Siakam, OG, VanVleet). This slower and meticulous development is allowing for these guys to have already lasted longer in the league than a lot of first rounders in their draft classes.

And you gotta then wonder what happens when a player‚Äôs potential is capped because of the place where they land. I read this on this sub a little while ago and it stuck with me - there‚Äôs an alternate reality where Steph Curry lands on a team where the coach tells him to stop chucking threes, he has a few ankle injuries, and is out of the league in 4 years. Just imagine how different the NBA would have been had that happened. The guy changed the game. But it was also cause he landed in a place where he could.

Who from this draft do you think landed in the best spot for long term growth?

TL;DR - I wonder if all the kids getting drafted pray before draft night to not get picked by the Kings. My thoughts and prayers to Haliburton.","[Discussion] What if Giannis/Jokic had been drafted elsewhere, and why the team you‚Äôre drafted to is probably as important as your talent/ability"
351,nba,"I know I'll get a lot of hate for this but I think someone should say it. After the Seattle and Las Vegas expansion or even with them, I think should come the ""Missouri Expansion"". This would have an NBA team in Kansas City, and St. Louis. Why might this be a good idea? Well for starters Missouri has no NBA currently. St Louis, and Kansas City both border other states. I think the southwest people from Illinois would become big St. Louis fans just like they are for the Cardinals. I think that people from the east side of Kansas would become fans of a Kansas team. St. Louis is one of the biggest metro populations in the US and Kansas City is growing. Both teams are decently spaced out from other teams, unlike some other expansion ideas. Both cities don't have the state college near them so they would pull tons of basketball viewers. Both the cities are also distanced apart, and both have had NBA teams in the past. If you bring up the point that St. Louis and KC can't both have a team. It was done in the NFL for a while until the rams left (illegally) and there are the Royals and the Cardinals. I think if the NBA expanded with STL and KC at the same time with Las Vegas and Seattle, they would move Pelicans and Grizzles east, and add St. Louis to the east. Then they would have the other three expansions all in the western confrence. Kansas City and St. Louis people what are your thoughts? These two cities would also be ideal spots for teams like the Kings (would be great for them to be in KC again) and the Pelicans to transfer to if they ever do go for.",Missouri Expansions

Asterisk reason: Kevin Durant ruptured his Achilles tendon in Game 5 and Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6. Kawhi Leonard rested all season and a timely gust of wind at the end of Game 7 against Philadelphia 76ers nudged the ball just enough to fall in the basket. Unfair.

2018 NBA champions: Golden State Warriors*
Asterisk reason: LeBron James ‚Äúpretty much‚Äù broke his hand. Chris Paul‚Äôs hamstring popped. And if that‚Äôs not enough, the Game 7 referee audit produced by the Houston Rockets that showed 81 potential missed calls that cost the Rockets 18.6 points. Fraudulent championship, certified by accountants.

Asterisk reason: Kawhi Leonard landed on Zaza Pachulia‚Äôs foot while up 23 in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals and Leonard never played again. But mostly: Kevin Durant joined a 73-9 team because of a cap spike. Scandalous.

2015 NBA champions: Golden State Warriors*
Asterisk reason: Did Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving even play in the Finals? Also, James Harden tallied 12 turnovers in the Western Conference finals-clinching loss in Game 5, but it‚Äôs unclear what another referee audit might uncover. Very questionable circumstances.

2014 NBA champions: San Antonio Spurs*

2010 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers*
Asterisk reason: In Game 7, the Lakers took 21 free throws in the fourth quarter while the Celtics took 17 all game. You tell me.

2009 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers*
Asterisk reason: Kobe Bryant dodges LeBron James yet again. King James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 8.0 assists for the 66-win Cavs in the Eastern Conference finals, and somehow it wasn‚Äôt enough. Of the 229 individual opponents that Kobe faced at least 20 times in his career, Kobe‚Äôs lowest win percentage came against LeBron, losing 6 of his 22 games against the four-time MVP, per Basketball Reference. Kobe and the Lakers faced Dwight Howard instead. Lakers catch another break.

2001 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers*
Asterisk reason: The Lakers lost both games to Ray Allen and the top-scoring Milwaukee Bucks in the regular season, which is notable because Allen all but said the Bucks-Sixers Eastern Conference finals was rigged so the NBA could get regular-season MVP Allen Iverson and Philadelphia in the Finals against the Lakers. Bucks fans have already asterisked this one for years.

1985 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers*
Asterisk reason: Celtics starter Cedric Maxwell, who won the 1981 Finals MVP, missed 25 games following knee surgery late in the season and was a shell of himself upon his return. The Lakers cruise again with their Finals opponent battered. 

1981 NBA champions: Boston Celtics*
Asterisk reason: To win the NBA Finals, the Celtics needed to beat a 40-42 Houston Rockets team. Not a typo. If that‚Äôs not asterisk-y enough for you, I don‚Äôt know what is.

1980 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers*
Asterisk reason: Philly, as it was in 1982, played the Lakers in the Finals with the burden of playing an extra series. With less miles on their tires, the Lakers cruised to the title against their more-fatigued foe. Soft!

1979 NBA champions: Seattle Supersonics*
Asterisk reason: In a rematch of the Bullets-Sonics Finals a year ago in which the Bullets won, the Sonics benefitted by injuries knocking out two Bullets starters Kevin Grevey (hamstring) and Tom Henderson (ankle) in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. Not a fair fight.

1978 NBA champions: Washington Bullets*
Asterisk reason: The defending-champion Blazers‚Äô repeat hopes were derailed when Bill Walton broke his foot in February while the team was 50-10 -- easily the best record in the NBA. No Walton, no glory.

1977 NBA champions: Portland Trail Blazers*

Asterisk reason: There were only 10 teams. Well, technically 11, but the Washington Capitols (correct spelling) folded halfway through the season. On Nov. 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons beat the Minneapolis Lakers 19-18. Final score.

1950 NBA champions: Minneapolis Lakers*
Asterisk reason: In the inaugural NBA season, there were 17 teams, six of which were contracted by Year 2 of the NBA. Rebounds would be introduced as an official stat in 1951. New rule: if rebounds aren‚Äôt counted, the title shouldn‚Äôt either.

After returning from injury last season I didnt get to watch most of the games he was actually playing, the stats in face value seems like he bounced back great from his injuries, but my question is.... How different is his game with his good years in DC to his first season with the rockets?  Is his stats just inflated, but in reality he's a negative? Or was he actually getting back into 80-90% of all star J.Wall who was a 2 way player?",To any fans of John Wall or Rockets/Wizards how has his game differed from the Wizards and the Rockets?
383,nba,"There's a handful who shoot &lt;=30% in one of either the reg. season or playoffs like Capela or Looney or Moses Brown but even then it's rare

unless he's wide open and right next to the basket, Gobert's lack of offensive touch in the paint, poor footwork, and inability to postup smaller defenders or finish through contact does not make him a great passing target. if he has to catch a pass outside of 3 feet or take even one dribble, it's [almost always a disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsX4W0hzxg)

not saying he should stray away from sticking to what he does best and start shooting more from 3+ feet, but his lack of offensive ability is his fault alone.

392,nba,"When Sacramento drafted Davion Mitchell, a lot of people said they were draft losers and that they didn't need another guard, the fit was terrible, etc. But I couldn't disagree more.

Despite all these guys being guards, they all offer different skill sets that won't overlap at all and they're all average/above average defenders. What makes most 3 Guard lineups terrible is the hit they take on defense due to size. But when one of the players in question is 6'7 (Haliburton), it can definitely be done successfully just like we saw in OKC with the CP3, Schroeder and SGA lineup. 

Point Guard: Davion Mitchell looks like he'll be an elite guard defender and will probably start due to his ability to potentially make it hard on opposing team's starting PG. His second best asset is his passing which is why I think he'll be fine starting at point guard, leaving most of the scoring to Fox. 

Shooting Guard: Fox imo was always more of a natural SG anyways, I think he's at his best when he's mostly focused on driving, getting to the paint trying to score. He's a perfectly fine passer, but I'd leave most of the facilitating to Mitchell and Haliburton because like I said, Fox is better he's looking for his own shot imo.

Small/Point Forward: Haliburton being 6'7 makes it extremely easy to slip in that SF position. He's a good facilitator and spot up shooter as well, so his skill set isn't overlapping with either Davion or Fox. Additional playmaking at multiple positions has never hurt any team.

TL:DR: All three of these guys can start together due to their skillsets not overlapping, all being capable defenders and the size of the lineup.","Why a 3 Guard lineup with Fox, Mitchell and Haliburton can work"

The visualization can also compare field goal accuracy compared to field goal attempts by zone. One data insight from these quadrant analyses is that the Knicks shoot above average from three (39% FG% accuracy) but are below average when it comes to the percentage of shot attempts from three which may mean they could be taking more three point shots.

400,nba,"So someone just posted about the best and worst midrange shooters in the nba, and checking the stats out, one person stood out to me: Anthony Davis. Particularly because of his Bubble run.

So here are a list of his midrange efficiencies, starting in 2013 (in 2012 he shot 28%, but he was only a rookie)

*2013-14:* ***40.1%***

*2014-15:* ***43.4% (50% in the playoffs)***

*2015-16:* ***42.4%***

*2016-17:* ***42.8%***

*2017-18:* ***36.4% (36.7% in the playoffs)***

*2018-19:* ***35.5%***

*2019-2020:* ***34.9% (49.6% in the Bubble!!!)***

*2020-2021:* ***34.8% (25.0% in the playoffs)***

His 3 point shot has also been rather ineffective as of late, as outside of the Bubble, he is a career 23% 3 point shooter in the playoffs. 

And since 2015, he follows much of the same pattern in his 3 point shot, in that he went from 32.4%, to 29.9%, to 34.0%, to 33.1%, to 33.0%, to 26.0% in those 6 years

Scottie Pippen summarized it

To put this into a brief perspective, I compared his 2020-2021 regular season numbers to slightly lowered league averages, lowered since the league is leaning more and more towards the three pointers, which is unfair to Simmons.

[Here](https://imgur.com/Bukrg07) is a quick graph showing Simmons' numbers relative to the lowered leauge averages. **He shot eight percent as much three pointers than the average NBA player** did last season. Which also happens to be his career three-point percentage, eight. What a coincidence! At this point it's a national emergency when he takes a three.

&gt;!(Most of the statistics used in this post are from 2020-21)!&lt;

# Shot Selection

Okay, but I want to take this to another level. After analyzing some more of the Fresh Prince's [shot location metrics](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bm5gsf/oc_ben_simmons_is_quietly_shooting_100_from_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and totaling them throughout his career, I found out that Simmons takes a whopping **70 percent of his shots within 5 feet of the basket**. For context, (in the past four seasons) King James takes around 44 percent of his shots in that range. 

=== WIP

This area of the court is generally dense in shots, you probably wouldn't find any player with lower than 20 or 30 percent from within 10 feet, just because the shot is often better and easier closer to the basket. But I mean, nearly 70 percent close to the basket is unheard of for a point guard, shooting guard, small forward, heck, anything other than a center

====

If we back it up another 5 feet, then Ben is shooting **91 percent of his shots within 10 feet of the basket**. Meanwhile LeBron is taking 51 percent in that range.

[Here](https://imgur.com/TUf0iVB) is a chart showing the frequency of shots taken relative to the location, comparing Ben Simmons, LeBron, and the League Average. As you can see, Simmons shot frequency practically skyrockets once you get within 5 feet of the basket, and it's basically flat from 14 feet or more. Compare this to the LA and LeBron's who's also increase drastically near the basket, but also increase past the three-point line, which is the difference between them and Simmons. &gt;!The graph is basically from 0-5 feet not 0 feet away. Couldn't figure out how to display it super clearly, sorry!)!&lt;

Taking a bunch of shots near/in the paint is fine, but the difference here with Simmons is that it's virtually the *only* shots he takes.

# Opportunities

*Disclaimer: There's no way to get this metric to be 100% accurate, but I think I found the best way to do it.*

We already know how much of his shots Simmons takes at different distances from the court. The NBA also provides us with shot statistics based on how far away the closest defender is. Sadly, they don't provide us with the two statistics combined, but we can work around that. 

For example, we know that Simmons shots 64.5% of his shots when there is a defender within 2-4 feet with him. This totals to 376 field goals attempted this season. As stated before, Simmons takes about 70% of his shots within five feet of the basket. We can multiply these two metrics to get a **rough estimate** of his frequency of shots within five feet of the basket, *and* with the closest defender being within 2-4 feet of Simmons.

Using this approximate formula, I can confidently say that Ben Simmons has a higher frequency for taking a shot very close to the basket (&lt;5ft) with a defender all over him (&lt;2ft) than shooting ***thirty-one*** wide-open (&gt;6ft) mid-range (outside key, inside arc) jump shots. Think about that for a moment.

I would argue free-throws are midrange shots, but easier. They're shot from one of the closest positions to the basket, and you get to [take your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mevj8hMB34) to shoot them.

That being said, I've put serious thought into this and I am drawing a blank on other players who this might be true for. 

Let's get the obvious out of the way here, Trae is Young. According to my findings the average age of an NBA player is 26.28, whereas Trae is 22, significantly below average!

Now on to other players. As I eluded to above, this have not been an exhaustive research project, so feel free to chime in if I've missed someone. For your consideration I've made a list of some players which I carefully reviewed to see if their names were representative, and in all cases I found that they were in fact entirely duplicitous. 

Daneul House - Not actually a house  
PJ Washington - Not actually a state, or a district, or even from Washington  
Klay Thompson - His father's name is actually Mychal, not Thomp  
Draymond Green - Not actually green  
Michael Porter Jr - I have never seen him carry luggage   
De'Aaron Fox - A human  
Ball brothers - None of them are actually balls  
Kawhi Leonard - Has never appeared on the big bang theory  
Russell Westbrook - Is actually from the west coast, but is not a body of water  
James Harden - Actually appears to soften (get fatter) with time, not harden!  
Maxi Kleber - Not an adhesive  
Steph Curry - Not curry  
Jimmy Butler - Actually is a professional athlete, not a butler  
Derrick White - Actually african-american  
Blake Griffin - Not really a griffin  
Julius Randle - No evidence suggests he snitches to Miss Finster  
Jrue Holiday - A person, not a holiday  
Lonnie Walker - Also runs and jumps   
Kris Middleton - The middle of a ton would be 1000 lbs, Kris has a listed weight of 222 lbs, significantly less!

I could go on, but I'll rest my case here. Unless someone can pose a reputable counter argument, I really think that Trae is the only truly honestly named player in the league. This is an underrated stat that a lot of analytics guys won't talk about, but I think it's time we finally address it.",Trae Young is one of if not the only player in the league who has an honest surname

Regular season is just another name for the qualification round. It's honestly the biggest money grabbing non-competitive thing I've heard of. Of course players are gonna ""load manage"" because it's really stupid to be playing back to back games just for qualification when over half the teams qualify. I get seeding plays a factor, but honestly risking the well being of a player is not worth it at all. No other physically demanding sport at that level requires people to go back the next day and compete just as hard especially when there's nothing major on the line. The whole ""regular season"" is basically as valuable as the group stages in football. But atleast in football we don't put as much stock into seeding yh sure if you can avoid a big team you try but the main focus is to qualify then you rest players because the next round is the most important. It makes the whole season worse because you get all these pointless injuries and don't even get to see the best players play but instead see teams win just because everyone else was injured because of money grabbing organisations that want to dilute the sport. Take this year for example we didn't see Kawhi/Paul vs LeBron/AD or the winner of that vs a fully healthy NETS team. Nope instead we see two teams who might not even be there if it wasn't for other players getting injured. I'm so glad the Americans failed at trying to ruin Football!!!",NBA season is awful

&gt; Beverley‚Äôs status as a veteran with playoff experience may also make him a little easier to include in a possible trade offer for Ben Simmons. While certainly not anything close to a headliner, Beverley‚Äôs defensive chops and ability to hit open 3s would help Philadelphia a lot more than any combination of Culver and/or Hernangomez.

&gt; The Wolves have continued to have discussions with the Sixers on Simmons, sources said, but the lack of win-now assets they could provide the Sixers in their pursuit of a championship has been a hindrance. A third team would almost assuredly have to be brought in to get more immediate impact assets to the Sixers, and that is a complicated endeavor.","[The Athletic] The Wolves have continued to have discussions with the Sixers on Simmons, sources said.

576,nba,"We saw it this season with players like Josh Hart, Lauri, Schroder, Oladipo, and few others not getting the offers they're looking for as a lot of teams ran out of space quickly or didn't want to possibly be left on hold with a RFA. I think the top level talent will continue to get their big contracts, but I think there's going to be somewhat a change of guard with these lower tier guys being overpaid as regularly.

For instance John Collins was pretty hard set on getting the max, but had to settle for 125 million over 5 years. With a new team he would have gotten roughly 120 million over 4 years with 28 million a year(roughly 25% of the salary cap and also technically the cheapest max deal a player can get off their rookie deal without any accolades that would get them a larger max).

Atlanta of course did not end up offering this and stayed with their offer and no other team bothered sending him a max that could have just been matched while preventing them from spending money elsewhere.

I feel like this will continue to be a thing as some of the teams that routinely have cap space will also be capped out soon(Thunder with Shai getting a super max, Kings with Fox, Knicks with RJ and Randle, Pelicans with Randle soon). Basically a lot of teams, even the bad ones, are going to be capped out and more likely to save that cap for role players/ability to take on contracts for picks than taking a chance to max out a guy like Collins or heavily pay a guy like Schroder when they don't move the needle enough to warrant it.

Question is basically in the title, are we going to see a big change in how free agency and the type of pay guys will get(mostly affecting the middle to upper level players that are not quite stars but better than the average role player).","With so many teams capped out or being close to the cap, will GMs get the leverage back?"

&amp;#x200B;

A big reason for his poor durability is the fact that he does not have an elite second option that other superstars have. I mean Tobias Harris is good, but he isnt a James Harden, or Khris Middleton, Or Paul George, or Anthony Davis, or even a Jamal Murray. He is a great 3rd option who you can rely for some good shooting and iso when your stars are tired. He is not a bonafide second option. This puts extra pressure on JoJo to take on a much heavier scoring load than other stars. It is unfair to put the entire blame on Tobias when he is a good player however, because the Sixers starting lineup is an offensive mismatch. 2 non self creating shooters, a post up/spot up shooter, an all round scoring beast does not sound like a bad offense right? Then you factor in that the team does not have a point guard in the half court and thats where everything goes to shit. A certain player's presence on the roster means that the lack of playmaking is woefully exposed as teams are free to double Embiid, who while has improved from passing out of doubles, still cannot be an effective offense as that is not his strength. Essentially their offense becomes either a JoJo iso, Tobias iso or some miracle seth curry play. There is no clear offensive system and that is because of a certain player and not fully on the coach. Imagine how much more potent the system can be with a point guard running the offense, taking advantage of all the shooters in the team and most importantly taking the load off embiid when can significantly improve his durability. This means lesser postups/scoring from double teams and more easy buckets. A big reason for Nikola Jokic's durability is the presence of another ball handler who can take the pressure off him anytime, especially in the regular season. I cannot imagine Jokic scoring 30 points every game on his own and then being able to play playoff games without even being a bit tired so I sympathize with JoJo here since he needs to carry a gigantic offensive load every game which is bad for his body and offense. There are some special superhuman cases who did this like Hakeem but its unfair to expect your star to be a top 10 all time player.

**2012 NBA Finals: Miami Heat defeat OKC**

&amp;nbsp;

Miami Top 3 players: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, **Chris Bosh**


Chris Bosh regular season stats: 18ppg, 7.9rpg, 1.8apg, on 49/28/82


Chris Bosh Playoff stats: 14ppg, 7.8rpb, .6apg, on 49/54/83 shooting

James Harden Playoff: 16.3ppg, 4.5rpg, 5.1apg, on 44/41/86 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Chris Bosh was an All Star this year and played off ball as much as he could while still remaining effective. He was still a crafty scorer around the basket, being much faster than other guys his size without giving up too much strength. James Harden won 6th man of the year here. Backing up 2 ball dominant players in Westbrook and Durant, Harden was overshadowed but blossoming.

&amp;nbsp;

This matchup features Bosh who got another All Star nod this season, and future Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi wasn‚Äôt the caliber player he would become, but he was a great defensive specialist. This was a close choice between Leonard and Manu. Manu had a more crafty offense, but Kawhi‚Äôs defense was already stellar here, but he didn‚Äôt get much recognition for it.

Draymond Green Playoffs: 13.7ppg, 10.1rpg, 5.2apg, on 42/26/74 shooting

Kevin Love Playoffs: 14.3ppg, 7rpg, 2.5apg, on 42/43/74 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Draymond takes home All Defensive 1st team honors this season while being an absolute problem on both sides of the court. He was the ultimate utility player, passing, shooting, and defending. Draymond came in 2nd for DPOY voting this year. Kevin Love misses being an All Star even in the East, and is forced to be more of a perimeter shooter with LeBron demanding space inside. He did his job well though and almost averaged a double double.

&amp;nbsp;

**2016 NBA Playoffs: Cleveland Cavaliers defeat Golden State Warriors**


Cleveland top 3 players: LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, **Kevin Love**

Klay Thompson Regular Season: 22.1ppg, 3.8rpg, 2.1apg, on 47/43/87 shooting


Klay Thompson Playoffs: 24.3ppg, 3.7rpg, 2.3apg, on 44/42/85 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin Love was not an All Star this season, but did put up a respectable near double double, and spaced the floor. Saddled with a lesser role next to LeBron and Irving, he stayed healthy for 77 games. Honestly at this point it‚Äôs a toss up for a few seasons between Klay and Draymond. They both performed similarly for multiple years supporting Curry. Klay was an All Star this year and as always could get hot at any minute and put a game away in the 2nd or 3rd quarter for the Warriors.

&amp;nbsp;

**2017 NBA Finals: Golden State Warriors defeat Cleveland Cavaliers**

&amp;nbsp;


Golden State top 3 players: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, **Klay Thompson**


Klay Thompson Regular Season: 22.3ppg, 3.7rpg, 2.1apg, on 47/41/85 shooting


Klay Thompson Playoffs: 15ppg, 3.9rpg, 2.1apg, on 40/39/79 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Cleveland top 3 players: LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, **Kevin Love**


Kevin Love Regular Seasons: 19ppg, 11.1rpg, 1.9apg, on 43/37/87 shooting


Kevin Love Playoffs: 16.8ppg, 10.6rpg, 1.7apg, on 44/45/84 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

With the addition of Kevin Durant, Draymond‚Äôs role on offense lowered, while still a beast on defense and a heady offensive player, his role and touches were reduced leaving Klay as the clear #3. Klay continued near identical production during the regular season but fell off a bit in the playoffs. Klay and Dray were both All Stars this year. Kevin Love only played 60 games this season, but the extra rest did him well and he returned to a near 20/10 guy averaging a double double and having him finally return to the All Star game. Although he was electric from 3 in these playoffs, the Kevin Durant Warriors were too much of a monster.

&amp;nbsp;

**2018 NBA Finals: Golden State Warriors defeat Cleveland Cavaliers**

&amp;nbsp;

Golden State Top 3 Players: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, **Klay Thompson**


Klay Thompson Regular Season: 20ppg, 3.8rpg, 2.5apg, on 49/44/84 shooting


Klay Thompson Playoffs: 19.6ppg, 4.1rpg, 1.8apg on 46/43/87 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Cleveland Top 3 Players: LeBron James, Kevin Love, **George Hill?**


George Hill Regular Season: 10ppg, 2.7rpg, 2.8apg, on 45/42/79 shooting


George Hill Playoffs: 9.2ppg, 2.2rpg, 2.2apg, on 45/31/77 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Again Klay plays his role with little variation putting in 20 points a game and being a walking heat check. This is Cleveland‚Äôs first year post Kyrie, and their 3rd best player varied by the night. With Love as the clear #2 guy, midseason acquisition George Hill could be considered Cleveland‚Äôs 3rd best player. Jeff Green, Tristan Thompson, and Jordan Clarkson all had games where they were the hot hand, but they truly didn‚Äôt have a 3rd star. While solid this team coasted off of LeBron being LeBron.

&amp;nbsp;

**2019 NBA Finals: Toronto Raptors defeat Golden State Warriors**

&amp;nbsp;

Toronto Top 3 Players: Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, **Pascal Siakam**


Pascal Siakam Regular Season: 16.9ppg, 6.9rpg, 3.1apg, on 55/37/79 shooting


Pascal Siakam Playoffs: 19ppg, 7.1rpg, 2.8apg, on 47/28/76 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Golden State Top 3 Players: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, **Klay Thompson**


Klay Thompson Regular Season: 21.5ppg, 3.8rpg, 2.4apg, on 48/40/82 shooting


Klay Thompson Playoffs: 20.7ppg, 4.1rpg, 2.1apg on 46/44/90 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Budding Pascal Siakam built his career off of this season playing 3rd fiddle behind Leonard and Lowry. He wasn‚Äôt an All Star, but this was the season people outside of Toronto took notice. Klay Thompson again rounds out Golden State‚Äôs big 3, but was injured during the finals. Golden State doesn‚Äôt lose here most likely if Thompson isn‚Äôt injured. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2020 NBA Finals: Los Angeles Lakers defeat Miami Heat**

&amp;nbsp;

Los Angeles Top 3 Players: LeBron James, Anthony Davis, **Kentavious Caldwell-Pope**


Kentavious Caldwell-Pope Regular Season: 9.3ppg, 2.1rpg, 1.6rpg, on 47/39/78 shooting


Kentavious Caldwell-Pope Playoffs: 10.7ppg, 2.1rpg, 1.3apg, on 42/38/82 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Miami Top 3 Players: Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, **Goran Dragic**


Goran Dragic Regular Season: 16.2ppg, 3.2rpg, 5.1apg, on 44/37/78


Goran Dragic Playoffs: 19.1ppg, 4.1rpg, 4.4apg, on 44/35/80 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is not on par with a lot of the names previously mentioned, but I guess that doesn‚Äôt matter when your #1 is LeBron James and your #2 is Anthony Davis. Caldwell-Pope is a solid shooter and defender. Dragic really turned it on in the playoffs but got hurt towards the end of the run. At times Dragic looked like an Allstar caliber player in his career.

&amp;nbsp;

**2021 NBA Finals: Milwaukee Bucks defeat Phoenix Suns**

&amp;nbsp;

Milwaukee Top 3 Players: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kris Middleton, **Jrue Holiday**


Jrue Holiday Regular Season: 17.7ppg, 4.5rpg, 6.1apg, on 50/39/79 shooting


Jrue Holiday Playoffs:17.3ppg, 5.7rpg, 8.7apg, on 40/30/71 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Phoenix Top 3 Players: Devin Booker, Chris Paul, **DeAndre Ayton**


Deandre Ayton Regular Season: 14.4ppg, 10.5rpg, 1.4apg, on 63/20/77 shooting


Deandre Ayton Playoffs: 15.8ppg, 11.8rpg, 1.1apg, on 66/-/74 shooting

&amp;nbsp;

Most recently we saw Jrue Holiday round out Milwaukee‚Äôs top 3, bring all NBA level defense and facilitating to the team, while occasionally being a game‚Äôs best scorer. While his efficiency scoring did a 180 in the playoffs, his defense and facilitating was exactly what Milwaukee needed. Ayton is a really good player with room to grow. He‚Äôs a potential All- Star and may soon be a top 10 big if he isn‚Äôt already.

&amp;nbsp;

**Some quick thoughts on this:**

&amp;nbsp;

For most contenders, your 3rd best player is a near All Star



Not only is the player an All Star, but it‚Äôs often a guy playing below his potential and sacrificing stats for the team



Inversely, it‚Äôs rarely a guy with a lower ceiling just being utilized really well




Unless your #1 player is one of the greatest of All Time, your 3rd best player is crazy important, and needs to be really good




In general, contenders have a handful of guys playing smaller roles than they're absolutely capable of, in order to win a ring



It seems like some contenders get their hands on a high upside prospect and that guy gets great experience turning him into an All NBA level players. This happened with Harden, Leonard, and potentially now Ayton.

So what are your thoughts? See anything I'm not seeing? Who is your 3rd best player, and does he stack up against the listed players?",[Discussion] How good does the 3rd best player have to be on a contender?

671,nba,"&gt;Each of Minnesota, Golden State, Sacramento and San Antonio has been consistently linked as a top Simmons destination, yet the overwhelming sense among league insiders continues to be that Simmons, for now, is expected to remain a Sixer once training camp opens on September 28‚Äîbarring a change of temperature with Damian Lillard in Portland. 

&gt;That appears to be the ever-important undercurrent to what has been routinely described as a ""James Harden-like"" package Philadelphia is seeking for any Simmons return. 

&gt;For the Sixers and president Daryl Morey to move Simmons, it will be with an eye toward maximizing Joel Embiid's prime. Therefore trading Simmons now for anything short of a haul that could immediately be flipped for Lillard, in the event he does request a trade, would be a devastating blow for Philadelphia's front office, and their efforts to pair Embiid with a bonafide superstar.  

But that Lillard request may not be coming anytime soon. 

&gt;There's certainly a possibility Lillard arrives at training camp, looks around Portland's locker room and determines the Trail Blazers roster has not been upgraded to his satisfaction. Yet there's a stronger belief in league circles that Lillard will at least venture into the regular season under new head coach Chauncey Billups, allowing him to revisit moving elsewhere before the trade deadline. 

&gt;Dating back to Morey's tenure running Houston, he has traditionally begun trade talks with offers that his counterparts deem outlandish as a means to set an extreme parameter for the ongoing negotiation. This year, several rival executives told Bleacher Report they believe part of Philadelphia's calculus behind those unrealistic offers has also been to assure Simmons' camp that the Sixers are at least attempting to move him. 

&gt;Toronto, though, was never going to entertain a framework of acquiring Simmons for OG Anunoby, Fred VanVleet and the No. 4 pick, which Philadelphia pitched the weekend before July's NBA draft.

&gt;San Antonio was open to discussing Dejounte Murray and Lonnie Walker IV before the draft, sources said, and the Spurs added more enticing future draft capital in their sign-and-trade that delivered DeMar DeRozan to Chicago. Could the starting points of that package be enough to truly intrigue Philly? Portland's eventual interest, as always, would factor heavily into any further discussions, too. 

&gt;Despite the awkward dynamic that could follow, Simmons may have no real choice but to join the Sixers in September and play his way to a new destination, regardless of the icy communication that has persisted all summer, dating back to Rivers' and Embiid's post-Game 7 press conferences.

&gt;Whether Simmons is amenable to that of course remains to be seen, but Philadelphia appears prepared for that outcome. Said one veteran front office voice, ""Daryl is not afraid to go into training camp with a potentially combustible situation.""

Any -- and all -- impactful free agents are gone. The Cavs spoke with the New Orleans Pelicans about the possibility of a Josh Hart sign-and-trade, sources tell cleveland.com, but that possibility apparently vanished Monday, when Hart moved closer to a three-year, $38 million deal to stay in New Orleans. Cleveland has also explored the trade market. Kyle Anderson, Terrence Ross, Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Cam Reddish, T.J. Warren, Thaddeus Young, Tobias Harris, Jeremy Lamb and Harrison Barnes are all said to be available. Reddish is a player the Cavs liked in the 2019 draft. They‚Äôve been in contact with Atlanta about him. But wings don‚Äôt come cheap.

In initial conversations, sources say most teams are asking for Cleveland‚Äôs 2022 first-round pick (with protections, of course), but that would be incredibly risky for a team with 60 total wins the last three years and projects to, in a best-case scenario, compete for a Play-In spot in 2021-22. Without the future first-rounder, which the Cavs seem unwilling to put on the table for any of the ‚Äúavailable‚Äù wings, interest turns to either Larry Nance Jr. -- one of the few adults and winning players on the roster -- or the pair of extra 2022 second-round picks (Houston and San Antonio). Does combining one or both with Cedi Osman get the Cavs anywhere?

But the definition of a superteam really seems to depend on what people see as its criteria, whether it'd be the number of top 5\~10 players on the roster, level of dominance, or others. The 2015-16 Warriors, for example, is a good case of divisive opinions forming on whether this team was a superteam or not, largely due to their NBA record 73 wins in the regular season. This does not mean, however, that there aren't clear-cut superteams like the current Nets or the 2016-17 Warriors.

People claim Lonzo was not a good fit in NOLA because he wasn't good in the halfcourt and that he only was a spot-up shooter. Meanwhile those same people want Point Zion/Point BI. So why does Lonzo have to be good in the halfcourt when he IS USED as an spot-up shooter? Also, Lonzo literaly was the only above average defender in the starting  line-up last year. Yes, Adams sucked last year and the same counts for Bledsoe. 

Meanwhile Pelicans fans are happy that Lonzo left and say they won the trade when they literaly got somebody who averages a worse 3p% last season on the same amount of shots who has no synergy with Zion/BI and need the ball in his hands (more then Lonzo). Also Lonzo-Zion connection was insane. After this trade Pels decide to throw a 38m/3yr bag at Josh Hart who has said that he wanted out. Josh is a great on ball defender and hustles hard but he shot 33% from 3 last year and the Pels need shooting? So they S+T the best shooter on the team who has great chemistry with the stars for a worse shooter who has no synergy but is better in the halfcourt where he won't touch the ball more then Lonzo and they give 38m/3yr to one of the worst 3pt% guards they have.

729,nba,"As a Piston's fan I've been wondering a lot about this recently. Fade for Cade worked! We got our guy... so now what?  Exactly how hyped should I be?

It happens that I'm doing an online python development course and one of the final assignments was to scrape data from a website and use the data to do some analysis.

Here's what I came up with. Draft data is from Wikipedia everything else is from Basketball Reference. I chose to use win shares for my analysis because it seemed the easiest to understand. Caveat: I'm not a statistician, data scientist, professional programmer, etc.  just a bored guy woking on a new hobby, so be kind. (I also generated some sweet box plots and scatter plots but r/nba doesn't allow images apparently, you'll just have to imagine them.)

Table 1:

&amp;#x200B;

|Pick Number|Average Win Shares / Season|Career Win Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5.82|71.93|
|2|4.29|47.95|
|3|4.53|51.20|
|4|4.03|44.07|
|5|3.78|47.41|
|6|2.99|27.65|
|7|3.03|30.12|
|8|2.79|30.06|
|9|3.38|39.01|
|10|2.78|30.00|
|11|2.56|27.25|
|12|2.38|22.65|
|13|2.53|27.31|
|14|2.14|20.50|

Looks good, right? Especially that career win shares average. Twenty games better than the next best number! But looking at the data it became obvious that those numbers were heavily skewed by a few outliers (\*cough\* LeBron and Kareem \*cough\*).  So maybe a straight average wasn't the best way to go. Here's what the table looks like for the median player at each draft position:

Table 2

&amp;#x200B;

|Pick Number|Average Win Shares / Season|Career Win Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|4.92|51.60|

|3|4.50|37.15|
|4|3.80|32.50|

|13|2.10|13.80|
|14|1.70|8.75|

This brings us back to earth a little bit.  Better than all the other picks but not by a whole lot.  Still 4.9 WS per season for an entire career is nothing to sneeze at. For context 4.9 WS is like last guy on the all-star team level.  This year Jaylen Brown was at 4.8.  Also, the owner of that 4.9 career average WS number is John Wall.  With the first pick a team has a 50/50 shot to get John Wall or better. Honestly that's not bad.

This is all great but what I and most fans really care about is championships.  This is why we put up with all the losing. For a small market team like the Pistons, we're not getting the  superstar free agent. It's draft or bust. So will a number one pick brings us to the promised land? Let's look at the data:

Table 3

&amp;#x200B;

|Pick Number|Championships with Original Team|
|:-|:-|
|1|20|
|2|4|
|3|11|
|4|7|
|5|12|
|6|9|
|7|4|
|8|2|
|9|4|
|10|9|
|11|14|
|12|5|
|13|8|
|14|3|

Wow, twenty championships have been won by number one picks on their original team! Over six more than the runner up... number 11? Unfortunately, this stat is also super misleading.  Of those twenty chips 15(?!) of them are accounted for by four players (Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Magic Johnson, and James Worthy)  playing on two teams (the Spurs and the Lakers). So, three all-timers and a hall of famer playing on two of the most stacked teams ever coached by two of the best coaches ever.  There was a lot more than draft luck that went in to winning those 15 championships. Remove those four outliers and theres around a 9% chance that any number one pick will win a championship with their original team.

Also, as a Pistons fan it's hilarious to me that one of the four number two picks to win a championship with the team that drafted them is none other than Darko Miliƒçiƒá. Maybe this *is* just a garbage stat.

Takeaway:

It should have been obvious from the beginning but the number one pick is not a magic bullet to a championship.  If anything what the data shows is that the true value of the number one pick over the rest of the draft lottery is the ability to draft the sure fire, can't miss, all-timer if one is available.  In years like this year the pick is still valuable, I'd take coin flip odds for Wall-or-better any day, but maybe not on a franchise saving level. Still, I'm hyped for Motor Cade (not sure about the nickname though). And who knows, maybe he is the next LeBron? Or maybe we'll suck again this year so we can pair him with another number one overall pick and *really* have a shot. Hope springs eternal.

Gregg Popovich took over the Spurs as the head coach in 1996-1997 season. We've all heard of the regular season success but just to go a bit in depth about it.  
  
In the last 24 years, the only players to have scored 50 or more points against the Spurs are [James Harden (2x), Jayson Tatum and Kyrie Irving](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=most+points+scored+vs+the+spurs+single+game%2C+since+dec+10%2C+1996) . This includes regular season AND playoffs. 
  
 
The crazier feat is 3 of those 4 scoring performances were in the last 3 years. Kyrie Irving's 57 point game came in 2015. Prior to that, the single game high was 46 by Allen Iverson set in 1999.  
  
That means an individual player (in the regular season+playoffs) failed to score 50+ points vs the Spurs for 6,666 consecutive days. Some notable players and their 'best' performances vs Pop's Spurs.","In the Gregg Popovich era, only three players have scored 50+ points against the Spurs"

He becomes a 15/6/6 combo guard with absolute lockdown defense and 40 percent from 3.

811,nba,,"[Chris Johnson] How many point guards got this in the bag @BenSimmons25 Details - Making live reads playing off the screen , High crossover into a power dunk finish"
812,nba,"Pg: Jalen Suggs 
Suggs fits the mold of what most NBA teams want from their point guard. Whether its shooting, passing, defending Suggs can do it all. He's also incredibly athletic. Suggs is the perfect guard who can create for others but also go and get his, while clamping down on the other end. Every modern NBA team wants this. 

Sg: Jalen Green 
Jalen Green is the ideal shooting guard. He is a great shot maker, and an incredibly explosive athlete. The primary objectives for most modern shooting guards is to, well, shoot (and defend), and Green does just that. He'll hit you with a flurry of smooth jumpers and acrobatic finishes on one end and hound you on the other end of the court. 

Sf: Cade Cunningham 
Cunningham fits the mold of the highly coveted point forward (guys like LeBron, Luka, etc.). Cade Cunningham is a good passer, with great feel for the game. He foes a great job of setting up his teammates and running the offense. He can also go out and get his, as he is an efficient shooter and fairly good three-level scorer. He's no slouch on defense either. Cunningham is an impressive off ball defender, with a knack for racking up steals and blocks. 

Pf: Scottie Barnes 
Scottie Barnes is your typical ""small"" ball four. Standing at 6'9"" with a 7'2"" wingspan, Barnes has the length and quickness necessary for an effective switchable defense. He's mobile enough to stay in front of quicker 4's, and lengthy enough to defend larger ones. Hes got good point forward skills, though his jumpshot is a bit of a question mark(not ideal in the modern NBA). 

C: Evan Mobley
Mobley is the perfect modern center. He is incredibly quick and mobile for a center, yet lengthy and large enough to battle down low with the big bodies of the league. Hes a good passer, can score, and has shown the ability to occasionally step outside and knock down threes. The ideal center in the current state of the league.",A starting lineup of the top 5 picks is the perfect modern NBA lineup

907,nba,"As someone who‚Äôs been watching basketball for years now, it‚Äôs evident to me that LeBron James is the most hated NBA player of his generation. 

Before LeBron, the people hated Kobe Bryant. I still remember everyone calling him a ball hog, inefficient, brick, and would bring up allegations from his past, etc. However, he didn‚Äôt get anywhere near the hatred that LeBron receives. 

I can go as far as to say he‚Äôs one of the - if not THE most hated athlete of all time. LeBron could do something good and people would still find a way to hate on it. It baffles me that a man who came from nothing and entered the league with such high expectations, and eventually surpassed those expectations on the court and did so much for his community off the court can be hated to this extent. 

To my knowledge, only Muhammad Ali was hated to a smiliar extent due to how vocal he was when it came to black vs white issues, plus his decision to refuse the army. But that hatred didn‚Äôt last too long, as he dominated in his sport and the love for him began to overpower the hate. As for LeBron, he‚Äôs probably one of the most popular and loved NBA players ever, but I think he has an equal amount of haters. 

There‚Äôs a difference between healthy hatred in sports and real hatred. A healthy hatred would be Celtics fans hating the Lakers, or Cavs fans hating GSW. But the hatred LeBron receives is rarely healthy. At a Pennsylvania rally in November 2020, the entire audience chanted ‚ÄúLeBron James sucks‚Äù when Trump mentioned LeBron‚Äôs name. What does LeBron have to do with these Trump supporters who have never watched basketball a day in their life? He literally has grown adults who don‚Äôt even watch the sport hating him just to hate. 

So why? Is it because he decided not to speak out against China on one occasion? Is it because he‚Äôs so vocal about black oppression in America? Is it because he‚Äôs the arguable GOAT and people aren‚Äôt willing to accept that? Or is it because he constantly defeats your teams in the playoffs and finals?

BTW I know saying anything positive about LeBron gets you branded as a ‚Äúbronsexual‚Äù, but I just wanna clarify that I‚Äôm no big LeBron fan. Just a fan of the game who doesn‚Äôt understand the hate.",Why is LeBron James hated so much?
908,nba,"As kings fans, we all expect that Hield will be traded in this offseason, considering we already have a full guard rotation with Fox, Haliburton, Terence Davis and now Mitchell. Because of this and the fact that he has shown signs of being unhappy, a trade should be coming...right??? 

When I looked at every NBA team to try and see if there was a team that would really like to have Buddy, I failed to really find a great fit. Of course the lakers would have been that team, and the pelicans maybe too, but now that Hart is back I don't think they have anything we want. That's the problem as well: the kings need forwards, as currently Barnes is the only starter quality forward on the roster, which is obviously a problem. Because of this situation and considering FA is done, I thought that the way to fix that was to trade buddy for one, but I just don't see a team that has forwards that they are willing to trade for buddy which the kings would also like. The sixers have been rumored to have interest, but they lack forwards we want ( G league god Paul Reed??? lol) but maybe the trade just ends up being Buddy for a first and salary filler.

917,nba,"So since NY signed Fournier to an ‚Äúoverpay‚Äù I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of the naysayers like to point out that he is someone who ‚Äúdisappears in the playoffs‚Äù, that ""he‚Äôs a regular season player who doesn‚Äôt show up when it counts"", etc. And to me this is such an outrageous take that I didn‚Äôt agree with long before we even signed him so I just want to take this time to put that narrative to rest. 

The context of Fournier‚Äôs shortcomings in the playoffs are boiled down to the fact that whenever he did make the playoffs with either the Magic or last season with the Celtics, he has consistently been on a team that is laughably outmatched. The Magic have been a perennial 7/8 seed for the past couple of seasons  so what does that mean? They get matched up with the East‚Äôs elite in the first round of the playoffs. The 2 times Fournier was in the postseason with the Magic they faced the eventual champions in the Raptors and the #1 seed in the Bucks. So right off the bat he‚Äôs at a huge disadvantage because as the Magic‚Äôs best wing creator/scorer he‚Äôs getting the opposing teams‚Äô best wing defender on him every game. And as we all know it's a different intensity in the playoffs than the regular season, defenses tighten up, schemes change, teams that didn't care as much in the regular season care a lot more now obviously in the postseason. 

So let‚Äôs look at the roster construction of those Magic teams. We all know those teams‚Äô bread and butter was their defense. Clifford was a good defensive coach and it helped them overachieve to make the playoffs. But when it gets time for the playoffs the thing that matters most is shot creators and having guys who can get their own shots to open the floor up for everyone. Who were those players on the Magic teams besides Fournier? Aaron Gordon? DJ Augustin? Michael Carter Williams? When you have those kinds of shot creators, it‚Äôs much easier for opposing defenses to key in on someone like Fournier who is actually an above average shot creator. The best player on that team tho was Vucevic, but he‚Äôs a big man who didn‚Äôt spend THAT much time on the perimeter so that made it much easier for the opposing defense to scheme around the Magic‚Äôs offense. Remember they‚Äôre playing the 1 or 2 seed again so the level of players in the rotation are far above what the Magic are equipped to deal with. So is it really a shock that someone like Fournier is struggling to score the ball efficiently? Not to me and imo it‚Äôs hard to blame or fault him for that. 

And let‚Äôs briefly bring up this past postseason where he and the Celtics faced who in the first round? The fucking Brooklyn Nets who had a healthy trio of KD, Harden and Kyrie. Again right off the bat Fournier is on a team that is going up against the presumed title favorites. And to make matters worse, fucking Jaylen Brown is out after Game 1, making it that much harder for the Celtics and Fournier. And despite that, he STILL managed to put a pretty decent stat line and shooting splits. 15ppg on 43/43/83 shooting

So for all the people who continue to point out Fournier‚Äôs 49 TS% in the postseason I ask you to please get off basketball reference for 2 mins and use context as to why he‚Äôs struggled in the postseason so far in his career",[Long Rant] The Mischaracterization of Evan Fournier in the postseason

931,nba,"Stupid question but does anyone know what the incentive is for players to want to be the first overall pick instead of the second if contractually, you're making just 1M a year more. 

The reason I bring this up is because of the recent Jalen Green comments saying that he would wanted to be the #1 pick but he didn't want to live in Detroit. 

This is [contrary](https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-i-want-to-live-in-detroit-jalen-green-pressures-pistons-into-drafting-him-no-1-overall-over-cade-cunningham-in-2021-nba-draft/) to what he said a few days before the draft, where he claimed that he really wants to live in Detroit. Obviously he was just lying to try to be the first pick but I wonder, if he knew he wouldn't like living in detroit, why would you want to get drafted there where you would have to spend the next 15+ years to earn the supermax if you're ever eligible for it? To make just $4M and live the next 15 years in a place that you aren't happy, it just doesn't seem like a good decision for both on and off the court purposes. 

You can obviously leave after the first 8 years, but then you miss out on an insane amount of money from a supermax (if you qualify for one obviously). I believe that Houston is certainly the better situation for the future in terms of basketball but I'd love to hear your thoughts.","Other than money, what is the incentive for players to want to be the first pick?"
932,nba,,"Jxmy posted a new video on Isaiah Thomas, and the video just made me pity IT."
933,nba,"Not too long ago, I had a brief vacation to Portland, Maine. While there, I sent a good friend of mine, a resident of Oregon and big Trailblazer's fan, a jestful text about being in Portland, and that we should catch a game. Immediately, it sparked a thought in me, wondering whether that was possible for every team in the league. Over the next couple days, I contemplated it, occasionally looking one up, just to satisfy a curiosity. But, eventually the dam broke, and after a talk with said Blazers fan, I convinced myself to solve it once and for all, and as a Computer Science student with a little too much time on their hands, let's make the computer do it.

However, I had one concern: I didn't wanna have to reorganize all the divisions, and possibly have a massive imbalance of locations. I gave the likenesses one stipulation, each swap must be to a city of the same name, but in a state that already had an NBA Team. Meaning the Trailblazers couldn't move to Maine, as the Augusta Lobsters have yet to leave my alternate fantasy reality, and join the NBA. I also had to make sure that states only got as many new teams as they had old ones. We'd be putting only one new team in Oregon, but we'd put four back in California.

I spent hours of doing maths out on paper, reading my notes on algorithms from previous classes, StackOverflow, and devising a backtracking technique to pick a unique place in every row of a 30x30 matrix, and eventually I had a godless python script, and my answers in a text document.

---

After 3.8442 seconds, the computation was done. It wasn't a perfect job, but without further ado, here are the results:

(Top to bottom is ordered by least alternative city-name options, to most.)

1. **Indianapolis Pacers** move from Indiana, to Indianapolis, Oklahoma. Your new home town has a population of zero, and the only other place with the name Indianapolis in the US or Canada.
2. **~~New~~ Orleans Pelicans** move from Louisiana, to Orleans, Massachusetts. We've dropped the New, because it's implied in the ""New England"" bit. Pelicans aren't native to the cape... but did make the news after they stopped by during a hurricane. It's as good a pretense as any to name a team.
3. **Orlando Magic** move from Florida, to Orlando, North Carolina. Despite being labelled as a ""populated place"" on the only sources of its existence I could find, said population doesn't seem to be an easy metric to find. Maybe they can do some magic and populate the place.
4. **Los Angeles Clippers** move from California, to Los Angeles, Texas. However, I struck luck gold for this, and there are TWO Los Angeles, Texas'. The Clippers get the boring one in Willacy County, a Census-Designated-Place with 121 residents.
5. **Los Angeles Lakers** move from California, to Los Angeles, Texas. They, on the other hand, get the Los Angeles in La Salle county. Since, much like the signing of Karl Malone and Gary Payton, the city's namesake was a Promotional Stunt.
6. **Milwaukee Bucks** move from Wisconsin, to Milwaukee, Pennsylvania. The only real information of note about Milwaukee, PA is that its' elevation of 935 is 318 feet higher than Milwaukee, WI
7. **Sacramento Kings** move from California, to Sacramento, Illinois. Sorry to Kings fans, but this place barely exists at all. It was by far the shittiest o the Sacramento's, but only fitting for the Shittiest of California teams.
8. **Utah Jazz** move from Utah, to Indiana. Now, I know their city is technically Salt Lake City... but there is only one of those. And they're called the Utah Jazz, so it's only fair to find a place named Utah. They're now at least a little closer to the actual birthplace of Jazz, at least.
9. **Golden State Warriors** move from California, to San Francisco, Minnesota. I'm jumping back to using the city name, because there's no way in hell I was gonna be able to find another ""Golden State"". We'll see if Minnesota can live up to the reputation of being the second most populated place of white people claiming they loved Curry before it was cool, behind the United Kingdom.
10. **Minnesota Timberwolves** move from Minnesota, to Minnesota, California. As long as we allow the same grace we gave Utah, then we get a beautiful case of the Timberwolves and Warriors simple switching states! The wolves will be right at home at the base of Mt. Shasta.
11. **New York Knicks** move from New York, to New York, Florida. This place barely has a Wikipedia article, But luckily, despite leaving the ever bustling street economy of New York, the Knicks will still be surrounded by Panhandlers.
12. **Oklahoma ~~City~~ Thunder** move from Oklahoma, to Oklahoma, Louisiana. I couldn't include ""city"" as it made the already tight list of places drop down to zero. Oklahoma, Louisiana may not have anything, or really even appear on a map.. but on the bright side it's adjacent to Bayou Boeuf, a river(?) with an undeniably fun name to say.
13. **Chicago Bulls** move from Illinois, to New Chicago, California. Unlike old Chicago, New Chicago has 0.0000092% the population, with 25 people. I could have also picked Port Chicago, California which is a town that no longer exists, due to the fact that it blew up in the 40s, and the US government bought up all the land around it to prevent another disaster. If we can convince them to build a stadium, the maybe they can move in the future.
14. **Detroit Pistons** move from Michigan, to Detroit, Tennessee. Given that, like many of the entries on this list, this place is desolate and barely populated, it looks a bit rough for the Pistons and Piston fans, but, on the other hand this place on good street view already looks nicer than Detroit.
15. **Miami Heat** move from Florida, to Miami, Arizona. Not only is Miami a much more real place than like 75% of this list so far, but I'll be damned if you can find a place more fitting of the team name *heat* than Arizona.
16. **Philadelphia 76ers** move from Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia, New York. For a second team in a row, the 76ers are not only off to a moderately real place (~1800 people) but also, get this, the hometown of American Hero Cassius Coolidge, better known as the painter of the legendary ""Dogs Playing Poker"".
17. **Toronto Raptors** move from Ontario, to Toronto, Ohio. With a population of 5,000+, the Raptors will have a better time than a lot of other teams here. Not to mention it may be better for the Raptors players and their families, as housing prices in Ohio are orders of magnitude cheaper than it's current namesake... ah, wait, nevermind, I just realized they'd have to live in Ohio, so I take it back. This one's the worst.
18. **San Antonio Spurs** move from Texas, to San Antonio, California. Now, for a first on this list, there are three places with the name ""San Antonio"" in California. San Antonio Heights, on southern California, and San Antonio Valley, and San Antonio in northern California. Only two of them have Wikipedia pages, or any information I could find for that matter, Ironically neither of which is the plain ""San Antonio"" north of the bay area. For SoCal solidarity, we'll pick San Antonio Heights, and as well give them 5,000+ locals to be fans.
19. **Dallas Mavericks** move from Texas, to Dallas, Georgia. Dallas, Georgia is by far the largest city on this list, as it's a suburb city of Atlanta with 11,000+ people. Sucks for Mark Cuba I guess, but at least he's also now closer to his namesake. Their Wikipedia page also mentions Food Truck Friday, so that's exciting.
20. **Charlotte Hornets** move from North Carolina, to Charlotte, Michigan. Home of the world famous Basketballer, [Eric Menk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Menk), and major town right off the beautiful US Interstate 69, the Hornets couldn't ask for a better city in Michigan to settle in. (Just get used to the snow, and stop by a Meijer to appease the locals)
21. **Houston Rockets** move from Texas to Houston, Florida. This Houston, like a lot of entries on this list, barely exists, but it's at least right next to Camp Weed, which presumably will be the place that allows the rockets to get as high as their namesake, if they don't feel like making the drive to Cape Canaveral.
22. **Memphis Grizzlies** move from Tennessee, to Memphis, Texas. Unlike the previous entry, it's a real city with real things. It's a little hard to justify keeping the name Grizzlies, I'll be honest, but once upon a time, this Memphis was a good ol yeehaw cowboy town, and I'd say Cowboys are pretty darn Grizzly.
23. **Brooklyn Nets** move from New York, to Brooklyn, Wisconsin. Though a meagre village in the southern Wisconsin countryside, the town is already ready to support a team, as the local Smithfield Park (according to Wikipedia) has: ""a basketball court, a picnic pavilion, public lavatories with drinking fountains, and a playground"". No new arenas or extra money necessary!
24. **Phoenix Suns** move from Arizona, to Phoenix, Oregon. Surprisingly, there are a lot of places caleld Phoenix, but Oregon ended up taking the cake for this one. This city, however, fits the title of Phoenix so much better, as it, much like the mythical beast, it burned to ashes in 2020, and is now rising out of them!
25. **Denver Nuggets** move from Colorado, to Denver, New York. Denver is a Hamlet in the Empire state, and seemingly only has a post office. This may sound bad, until you remember the famous quote from resident butter eater, Nikola Jokiƒá: ""Every different horse has a different personality, like a human.""
26. **Boston Celtics** move from Massachusetts, to Boston, Ontario. Just outside Mississauga, this nice little town will be the perfect home for the Celtics. It will also mark the first time in a while that Boston gets to play in Ontario without the expressed intent of knocking the Leafs out of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
27. **Atlanta Hawks** move from Georgia, to Atlanta, California. Another place that hardly exists anymore, the town was founded in 1866 after a saloon was built there. Nowadays, the Hawks will have to be okay with trading in the historic Georgia peach, for it's distant relative, the Cherry, as a cherry farm is the only thing I could find on the map in Atlanta.
28. **Portland Trailblazers** move from Oregon, to Portland, Colorado. Another Census-Deisgnated-Place, Portland is a nice little territory with a population of 135 allegedly. There's a Yak farm Nearby, and the area is generally a lot less on fire.
29. **Cleveland Cavaliers** move from Ohio, to Cleveland Park, District of Columbia. This was by far the biggest copout of the list, as Cleveland Park isn't a town, city, or hamlet, but instead is a Neighborhood. But, it makes up for this by being named after the Late Great Grover Cleveland. Sorry Cavs.
30. **Washington Wizards** move from The District of Columbia, to Washington, Utah. Though more colloquially known as Washington, City, it's a nice large city, with a good sized community centre to host everyone's favourite Hogwarts reject team.

After all is said and done, the team with the greatest city population is now the Washington Wizards, with Washington, Utah having approximately 29,174 people.

The Pacers, Warriors, and Hawks now all play out of cities with populations of Zero.

The Magic, Bucks, Kings, Thunder, Pistons, Rockets, Nuggets, Celtics, and Trailblazers all live in places I couldn't find population data for, either because they barely exist or because they're unincorporated territories with no data.

The lowest official population of a city on this list greater than zero is the Los Angeles Lakers, as their Los Angeles Texas has a population of 20.

The City with the most options was Washington, with 15 other teams were located in states with a city called Washington. However, Washington was the only city name on this entire list that could be fond in Utah, so that pick was paradoxically guaranteed.

967,nba,"Rob Jones was an American basketball player who began his NCAA career at San Diego before transferring to St. Mary's, where he averaged a double-double (15 points, 10.8 rebounds) his senior year beside teammate Matthew Dellavedova. Despite averaging 2.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.6 blocks per game as well, he ultimately went undrafted. 

Still, basketball saved his life.

Rob Jones is a fairly typical name, but one that carries a dark past. His father is Jim Jones Jr.-- son of the infamous cult leader Jim Jones, who orchestrated the mass murder-suicide of 909 individuals at Jonestown in 1978.  

Rob is alive today because his grandmother, Jim's wife Marceline, pleaded with her husband to allow a small group of Peoples Temple members to travel to Georgetown, Guyana to participate in a youth basketball tournament. Among this group was Rob's 18-year-old father, Jim Jr., and uncles Stephan and Tim. Despite orders from their father to return to Jonestown for the fateful visit of U.S. Representative Leo Ryan (whose arrival and subsequent murder would spark one of the most atrocious events in modern history), the basketball team refused, and attempted to receive help from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown. Sadly, they were too late. 

Rob Jones recently returned to St. Mary's, and currently serves as the Gael's Assistant Athletic Director.

As discussed in the video do you think more teams using the sign and trades is here to stay and will it eventually lead to Big market teams exploiting it more to get players they wouldn't have been able to sign in the first place..like lonzo and derozan to bulls or butler to miami. Can't this lead to like maybe the clippers landing someone like Lavine next off season, combine Kennard  and Morris money and they can get a max guy wouldn't this inevitably lead to more tampering and smaller markets suffering.

Personally I feel the NBA will eventually clamp on it once a star forces a sign and trade to create a superteam. From what I understand the players salaries from previous contracts hasn't accounted for the free in cap for last season effectively wiping near 8m in cap for all teams..and rendering most without max space for 22.I see Beal if he finally leaves moving in sign n trade and Lavine if bull fail again unless they find a prohect like memphis or spurs attractive what other option will they have?",NBA sign and Trades: will this lead to the next KD and warriors situation

1002,nba,"With 2021-22 over/under win totals being released by Vegas recently 
(I think there's like 4 or 5 posts in the last couple days on here), and most major trades and free agency moves having been completed, you may be considering throwing some money on a team's win totals for the upcoming season. Before you do, I went through and compiled some historical data that might help you.

**Some Notes:** 

When I say ""record"" what I mean is how many overs and then how many unders. So if a team or coach is 9-7 it means that 9 times they won more games than Vegas predicted and 7 times they won less.

These records are from the 2004-05 season onwards. I picked this season because it was the first year with all 30 current teams after Charlotte moved to New Orleans and then got a new team again.

Seattle moved in 2008 but their records from 2004-2008 are included in ""OKC"". Similarly, BKN includes the records from when they were in New Jersey.

2011-12 was a shortened lockout season but Vegas refined their projections right before the season began so this year was counted in the records.

2019-20 is not counted because Vegas voided their projections when the season was cut short and switched to the bubble.

**The Records**

ATL: 9-7

BOS: 8-8

BKN: 7-9

CHA: 9-7

CHI: 9-7

CLE: 5-11

DAL: 9-7

DEN: 11-5

DET: 7-9

GSW: 8-7-1

HOU: 9-7

IND: 9-7

LAC: 5-11

LAL: 6-10

MEM: 10-6

MIA: 7-9

MIL: 7-9

MIN: 3-13

NOP: 6-10

NYK: 5-11

OKC: 7-9

ORL: 8-8

PHI: 8-8

PHX: 7-9

POR: 9-7

SAC: 5-11

SAS: 13-3

TOR: 9-7

UTA: 11-5

WAS: 8-8

**Takeaways**

Vegas is generally pretty good. 19 of the 30 teams are either .500 against the projections or within one season one way or the other of .500.

Denver, Utah, and San Antonio are the safest bets to hit the over. Not surprisingly, three teams with a history of stability in the front office/coaching routinely outperform expectations. Two of the five times Denver underperformed were the 13-14 season and 14-15 season with Brian Shaw (Karl was 6-3 and Malone is 5-0). Similarly for the Jazz, Tyrone Corbin was 2-2 versus Vegas projections with Sloan going 4-2 and Quin being 5-1. Pop is just Pop.

Memphis is sort of an anomaly. Their record is the 4th best but they've had substantial turnover in their head coaches. Their roster stability has been stronger than most teams however, and I think Memphis suffers from a similar reputation as the other 3 safe bet teams in that small market/boring teams are projected to perform worse.

On the other side, and again unsurprisingly, bad teams with bad front offices are safe bets to hit the under. Sacramento, Minnesota, New York, Cleveland, and the Clippers are the worst of the bunch.

**Other (maybe) Important Notes**

Lebron led teams are 5-12 against the projections. A few years (mostly the last 2) are due to injury but what it tells me more than anything is that Lebron led teams will typically try and coast a little in the regular season before turning it up in the postseason.

Teams are 57-81 against projections in seasons where they changed coaches.

Speaking of coaches, we all agree coaching matters but there really isn't a ton of correlation between quality of coach and overperforming vs underperforming. Pop is an outlier here since he is 13-3 but here's the records from some other coaches we like to talk about on this sub:

Kerr: 6-2

Snyder: 5-1

Malone: 5-2 (including his two Kings years)

McMillan: 7-5

Thibs: 4-6

Monty: 4-2

Carlisle: 6-9

Vogel: 5-4

Spo: 6-6

Doc: 6-10

Walton: 2-2

Donovan: 3-2

Kidd: 2-3

**How to make money for 2021-22**

Based on current projected win totals these are the bets I'm targeting:

Pacers UNDER

The line at 43.5 seems ambitious. They were on a 39 game win pace last year and lost McDermott in free agency. While Carlisle is familiar with Indiana having coached there on two separate occasions already, coaching changes favor unders. There's also a distinct possibility Indiana moves Brogdon, Turner, or Warren at some point this offseason or next season before the trade deadline if they aren't in a playoff position.

Bulls OVER

The line is at 39.5. The Bulls were on a 35 game win pace last year and while there has been argument over whether the moves they made in free agency put them on the ""contender"" level in the East, I don't think it's arguable that they got better. They needed a defensive minded point guard and got one. They needed a playmaker to mesh with Lavine/Vucevic and lead a bench unit and got one. Donovan isn't the best coach in the league but he averaged 49 wins with OKC and overperformed Vegas projections with the Bulls last year.

Charlotte OVER

The line is 36.5. Charlotte was on a 37 or 38 game win pace last year. They've added key veterans to a roster filled with young talent. Borrego has beat Vegas projections in both full years and would have beaten them in 2019-20 (he won 23 out of 65 games before the bubble and was projected at 23.5).

Mavericks UNDER

The line is 48.5 and the Mavs were on a 48 game win pace last year. New coach Jason Kidd underperformed in his one year with the Nets but he did beat Vegas expectations in his first year with the Bucks. With Porzingis as a question mark and not much outside of Luka, I think they make the playoffs but miss the over.

Pelicans UNDER

The line is 38.5. After a 35 game win pace last year they made pretty significant changes. In addition to a coaching change they subtracted Lonzo, Bledsoe, and Steven Adams while adding Valanciunus and Devonte Graham. Nola is intriguing but I think just misses out on the over.

Bonus - Spurs OVER

Line is 28.5 and yes it's absolute homerism. But betting on the Spurs to hit the over is as close to a sure thing as you can find. Pop needs 26 wins for the all time record and I expect him to get it which already puts them close. Even with losing DeRozan, Gay, and Mills, after a 37 game win pace last year I have them winning between 30 and 35.","How good has your team been at beating the Vegas win total projects?

In his breakout season in 2011, Bynum averaged 18.7 PPG, 11.8 RPG, and 1.9 BPG on 55.8 FG%. He took the next year off due to injury and could never recover. 

Bynum is now only 33. To put it in perspective, 33 year-old Shaq was averaging 20 PPG, 9.2 RPG, and 1.8 BPG on 60% FG during his second season with the Miami Heat. Without his career-ending injury, we might be discussing Bynum's place amongst the greatest centers of all time as he enters the tail-end of his career. 

Which brings me to my comparison - Yao Ming. At age 24, Yao average similar numbers to Bynum in just his 3rd season in the NBA - 18.3 PPG, 8.4 RPG, and 2.0 BPG on 55% FG. Yao best scoring season came two years laters in 2006, where he averaged 25 PPG, 9.4 RPG, and 2.0 BPG on 51.6% FG.

I wrote much more about the Goran Dragic situation last week, and I still believe it‚Äôs more likely the Mavericks hold out for a buyout than trade for him now given Toronto has no reason to waver on its desire for prospects back. But that‚Äôs an intriguing idea I hadn‚Äôt yet considered.

Another critical domino is the team‚Äôs interest in Lauri Markkanen, which Marc Stein reported last week. I‚Äôm underwhelmed by Markkanen as a core part moving forward, but curious in a three-year deal ‚Äî the minimum number of years needed for a signed-and-traded player, which any deal bringing him here would have to be ‚Äî under his market value.

Chicago isn‚Äôt incentivized in helping the Mavericks for no cost at all. If Markkanen agrees to the qualifying offer, he could still be a rotation player and an interesting trade target around the deadline on a one-year, $9 million deal. While players who sign qualifying offers automatically earn no-trade clauses, Markkanen knows his future isn‚Äôt in Chicago and probably would approve a right trade to a contender.

The two paths I could see Dallas taking to get him:

Dallas would love to convince Markkanen to sign under his market value ‚Äî and what is market value, if the market hasn‚Äôt provided him the $15 million annually he hoped for ‚Äî and fit him into the team‚Äôs $11 million traded player exception (TPE). That‚Äôs beneficial for two reasons: 1) there‚Äôs less pressure for Markkanen to be anything but a useful rotational player for the team given his questionable fit starting next to Kristaps Porzingis, and 2) he‚Äôs an appealing player who‚Äôs still 24 and who the team could trade for a better-fitting one. Markkanen wouldn‚Äôt leap at that offer, especially since teams who still have the midlevel exception could also offer him contracts in that range, but he could eventually decide that‚Äôs his best business decision. Dallas would have to send something beneficial back to Chicago, but it would be draft- or prospect-related rather than a rotation player.


Dallas could offer Markkanen, say, a three-year deal worth $44 million and send back about $10 million in offsetting salary in a direct trade not involving its TPE. I‚Äôve heard Chicago has interest in Kleber; it‚Äôs a riskier deal for Dallas giving up both a rotational player and signing Markkanen to a higher salary point. It might be a worthwhile gamble, although you would have to really talk me into it. Kleber has been the better player in past seasons ‚Äî or, at least, the more useful one for a team with postseason aspirations. He‚Äôs struggled in both postseasons, but he was injured throughout the most recent series against the Clippers. Would you trade him and Trey Burke for Markkanen at that price point?",[The Athletic] It's more likely the Mavericks hold out for a buyout than trade for Goran Dragic now given Toronto has no reason to waver on its desire for prospects back. Chicago has interest in Maxi Kleber in a Markkanen sign-and-trade with Dallas.

1034,nba,"Kawhi had a player option for $36M but instead opted out to sign a deal with a first year salary of $39.3M. This sequence caused the Clippers to lose a disabled player's exception which they could have used to sign a player at $9.5M since they can no longer make a case that the injury was unexpected. It also likely pushed them to trade Beverley &amp; Rondo for Bledsoe as the $5.2M in that trade's salary difference helps them save $30M in taxes. I'm not saying all the blame should fall on Kawhi for looking out for himself because billionaire Steve Ballmer should not break a sweat over $30M.

1058,nba,"Case:
For the first time since Jimmy Butler was in the city of Chicago, there are true playoff aspirations for the Bulls. With the moves for DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball, this makes an impressive projected starting lineup of Ball/Lavine/DeRozan/Williams/Vucevic. 

However, there are some blatant flaws with the roster: namely defense and depth. 

In terms of depth, the only players on the Bulls roster currently who are worthy of rotational minutes and aren‚Äôt starters are Coby White, Alex Caruso, and possibly Tony Bradley. Troy Brown Jr is a project, Omari Spellman is lucky to be in the NBA, and their other recent draft picks will likely spend most of the year in the G League. However, this could change with a Markkanen sign and trade.

On the defensive side of the ball, the Bulls were not great there after the Vucevic trade, and will likely see the same result with the absences of Thad Young, Daniel Theis, and Al-Farouq Aminu. But, the addition of Lonzo and Caruso could potentially help these issues. However, the lack of a defensive center means that the Bulls are going to be dominated night after night in the paint, which will lose them games against even a mediocre front court. 

But, the offensive output of the Bulls may push all these issues aside. Each member of the big 3 is capable of putting up 23-25 PPG, and surrounding players like Lonzo and Coby White should see scoring boosts with less attention being focused on them. Plus, a little development from Patrick Williams should make him a consistent threat on catch-and-shoot treys.

Not there defensively as Simmons, but after a few years with Pop, he‚Äôs looking more  active defensively and basketball IQ is better. However, his prime years are on the verge of finishing, if not have already. 

Arguments for Simmons: Great play maker and great defender. Has some serious offensive woes, but he‚Äôs young and may still have room to grow offensively under the right training and coaching staff.  Seems like he has more mental obstacles than lack of skills.

1079,nba,"General framework: Portland sends Dame to Philly, Philly sends some combo of Maxey/Thybulle/Milton/first round pick(s) to Portland and sends Simmons to MN, MN sends a ton of first round picks to Portland. Throw in McDaniels if need be. I believe MN would also need to send out Beasley and Prince to make the salaries work. 

It seems that this trade could be at least reasonably justified for all parties involved. 

- *If* Dame wants out, he gets to go to a contender to pair up with an MVP-caliber center in Joel Embiid. 

- Simmons gets his wish of getting out of Philly. He goes to a team with lower expectations (i.e. less pressure) and where he wont be asked to do as much on offense, while also pairing up with old friends/teammates in KAT and DLo.

- Philly rids themselves of Simmons and gets an ideal running mate for Embiid while he‚Äôs in his prime. Dame is an all-NBA talent who can close out games and help Embiid carry the load on offense. Adding Dame helps to solidify them as a contender in the East. 

- 3-5 firsts and McDaniels is a steep price, but I think MN happily mortgages their future for Ben Simmons. He fits like a glove with KAT, and the spacing of KAT/DLo/Ant would give Simmons a lot of room to operate. While they may not be true contenders, a core of KAT/Simmons/DLo/Ant is a dynamic, young team that sets the Wolves up to be a legitimate playoff team for the foreseeable future. 

- Having to trade a superstar is never a position any team wants to be in, but Portland makes the most of an unenviable situation and maximizes Dame‚Äôs value. A king‚Äôs ransom of first round picks and a combo of young, talented prospects like McDaniels, Maxey, Thybulle, or Milton sets them up very well for a post-Dame future. 

I know that there are some caveats that make this a very unlikely trade. 

- First of all, we don‚Äôt even know if Dame will want out. If he doesn‚Äôt, then the entire trade idea is a moot point. 

- Secondly, we don‚Äôt know for sure that the Blazers *wouldn‚Äôt* want Simmons. My thinking on that though is Simmons/CJ/Nurkiƒá/Powell/Roco, while a solid core, is not really enough firepower in the West, especially considering the age of some of those players. Moreover, guys like McCollum, RoCo, and Nurkiƒá are great players who would have viable trade markets. Going full rebuild (if they even are open to that, which is another moving part that makes this trade even more unlikely) would net the Blazers an absurd amount of draft capital and would position them well for the future. 

- But if the Blazers are uninterested in Simmons, then Philly likely wouldn‚Äôt have the ammo to get Dame, or at least would have to gut their team of all young talent and give up a decade worth of picks (with the Stepien rule) to do so, while also still having Simmons on the team. If the Blazers aren‚Äôt interested in Simmons, Philly involving a third team with interest in Simmons (whether it‚Äôs the Wolves or another team) who would be willing to give up considerable assets for Simmons would then help facilitate Dame to the Sixers.

- Another moving part/caveat being that I am not a salary cap expert and am not sure if that framework is actually possible in terms of cap space. So even if all parties were amenable to the trade, from a practical standpoint, it may not be possible. 

There are a lot of moving parts/unknowns, but in a vacuum, it seems like a Dame to Philly, Simmons to MN, and a bevy of picks and young talent from Philly and MN to Portland works out reasonably well for all parties involved. Who would say no?","While it‚Äôs an unlikely scenario, IF both Dame and Simmons demand trades, is a three team trade of Philly-Portland-MN a viable possibility where all parties could be reasonably satisfied?"

In 10 years from now, if you're asked who will be remembered in 2060, who do you think will come up? It can't be 6-7 players, most eras are defined by 2-3 tops. (Like the 00's were defined by Shaq, Kobe and Duncan). 


For example, I think Giannis is a top candidate because he has a great personality and story, and is just hitting his prime. If he gets 3-4 championships he'd leave a big mark. On the other hand Kawhi who is even more accomplished is somewhat of a mercenary and I feel he'd need at least 2 more championships to really be an era defining player (same goes for AD who will need a lot of dominance to be remembered).","Assuming Lebron, KD and Steph are the defining players of this NBA generation, who do you think will be the defining players of the next one (when we look at it 10 years from now)?"

**My take on it:**

2003-2010: Nothing(KD consistently makes the playoffs because the East is weak, but can't carry the Cavs to a chip, while the now-OKC Thunder aren't good enough yet and LeBron is still young)

2011: Heat defeat Mavericks(I know KD lost to the Mavericks in 2011, but his performance(28 PPG on 56% TS) would have been good enough to beat the Mavs for LeBron, while the Mavs do the same defensive plan against LeBron as in IRL and beat the Thunder in the WCF)

2012: Heat defeat Thunder(KD averaged 31 PPG on 65% TS in the IRL finals, LeBron was still the better overall player but swapping them isn't nearly enough to change a 5 game series)

2013: Spurs defeat Heat(LeBron no help because Westbrook still gets hurt, KD not quite able to replicate his performance)

2014: Spurs defeat Heat(They beat LeBron and KD in real life as well, it's just that the order in which they do so gets switched)

2015: Warriors defeat Bulls(KD is hurt and Kyrie/Love aren't enough to win the East, LeBron is on the Thunder who that year are still inferior to the Warriors and lose a tight one in the WCF)

2016: Thunder defeat Cavs(KD played very badly IRL in the WCF, LeBron is able to finish them off and while KD still wins the weak East, LeBron beats him in 6)

2017: Warriors defeat Cavs(no change from IRL, Cavs again still cruise to the Finals as they did IRL but aren't nearly good enough to beat the Warriors)

2018: Warriors sweep Celtics(KD loses in 7 in the ECF)

2019: Warriors beat Raptors in 5(just like LeBron, KD is a non factor on the bad Lakers team this year)

2020: Heat defeat Nuggets(Nets just aren't good enough yet, but the Lakers not having LeBron really softens up the West)

2021: Bucks defeat Clippers(KD played well enough this playoffs to beat the Suns, but goes down to the Clippers in the WCF)","If you swapped the career paths of LeBron and KD(and also their ages), how successful would each one be?"

Especially if you send him there because the Warriors are trying to ""WIN NOW"" whereas the Raptors are rebuilding not even a title contender much less even a competitive team.

The package I would put together to send Siakam to Golden State:

- Golden State Warriors receive: Pascal Siakam 

- Toronto Raptors receive: Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman and Moses Moody 

* Pick swaps and draft picks I would throw in also

- Everyone wins in this trade really

- Siakam gets to compete for a team that's actually a title contender and if you pair him next to Draymond, Steph, Klay, Kuminga, Iggy and the rest of them...they easily compete with the Lakers, Clippers, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns in the West

- Toronto with their rebuild get Wiggins who is a hometown native. Plus he essentially becomes a #1 option or #2 option depending on certain things.

1175,nba,"The documentary itself was well done however there was a certain rhetoric that seemed out of touch. First off, the backgrounds of the players were interesting. As well as the perspectives of the brawl/aftermath. 

However, it seemed like the doc built a storyline that the Pacers were destined for success and were now the superior team to Detroit after getting Stak. It's strange that they didn't touch on the fact that the Pacers and Pistons actually met in the playoffs again in that same season. The storyline of ""we would've won if the fight never happened"" is flawed. They had the chance to go back to the Palace, beat the Pistons, and go onto win a chip (a caveat being Artest was out). However, they lost in six games.  

There is no footage I could find of that series other than Reggies last game (gm 6).

4. AD (Had a down year, but his impact for the Lakers can't be ignored for both ends)

1212,nba,"In the West:

- Utah Jazz could be a team to target Beverley. He could be the backup PG behind Mike Conley although they'd have to give up Joe Ingles or Royce O'Neale to get a deal done which would be too big an asking price in my opinion.

- Dallas Mavericks could be another team. He'd play behind Luka Doncic and the trade would be for Dwight Powell straight up. This could be something that happens if the Raptors overplay their hand and ask too much in return for Dragic.

- Portland Trail Blazers are a team that need to make a not-so-splashy splash. By trading for Beverley they put a defensive-minded guard behind Lillard and, in general, someone who will try hard on defense. Beverley played for new head coach Billups last season on the Clippers. The trade would be for Derick Jones Jr. and another piece. 

In the East:

- The Brooklyn Nets could be a landing spot for Patrick Beverley, although they are already very heavy at the guard position. Not accounting for Harden and Irving they have Bruce Brown, Jevon Carter, Patty Mills, and Cam Johnson. That being said, Carter and Johnson probably will not play unless an injuring were to befall Irving or Harden. Although, if their plan is to rest one of them every other game or so to manage their loads Patrick Beverley would be a great guard to have. The trade would be for DeAndre Jordan.

- The Washington Wizards could be on the shortlist too. Trying to make a playoffs with their new squad, Beverley for Thomas Bryant would make sense *sorta*. Depends how the Wizards value Bryant after being injured, being on the final year of his contract, and with the acquisitions of Harrell, Gafford, and Len. 

- Did someone say Jeremy Lamb? Another expiring for expiring deal that would help the Indiana Pacers in this specific case. Although they did just give the big bucks to TJ McConnell. A second unit of McConnell, Beverley, Holiday, Craig and Brisset would be something though.","[Serious] With Patrick Beverley likely on the move, which playoff contender should be targeting the 3&amp;D guard?"

While the Warriors don't need him to be a big points getter this season, with Klay back, and of course Steph there, they'll value someone that can provide offensive spark when called on. Kuminga has that in buckets.

I know Wiggins had a great season 2020-2021, but Kuminga is just so athletic, and has so much intuition for the game.

1242,nba,,[Highlight] Steven Adams levels future teammate Patrick Beverley with a hard screen
1243,nba,"Since the 2015-16 season, Rajon Rondo has played for the Kings, Bulls, Pelicans, Lakers, Hawks, Clippers and Grizzlies. In that same span, Dwight has played for the Rockets, Hawks, Hornets, Wizards, Lakers, Sixers and Lakers (again). That‚Äôs good for seven teams each. It actually goes back further, as Rondo spent the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons with the Celtics and Mavs respectively (nine teams in nine seasons)!

Rondo was Washed up completely and Pat Bev is a distraction who can't score at all. You literally NEVER want him taking a shot even wide open there is always a better option for offense.

1300,nba,"Hey all,

I just spent a few days (Thursday-Saturday) at Summer League and figured I'd give you all a recap of the experience in case anyone was interested.  Not sure you all care about my thoughts on specific teams or players so I'll leave that out of the recap but can answer questions if you want.  We didn't get a chance to see all the teams though.  I'll also try and answer and other questions you all have.

**Logistics**

We're from New York so we had to get flights, hotels, and all that stuff obviously.  Flights were really expensive even though we booked more than a month in advance but I don't think it was because of Summer League per se.  Just seems a lot of domestic flights are expensive nowadays because of COVID.  Hotels weren't more expensive than normal and we didn't have a hard time finding rooms.  

We bought tickets for the games a little more than a month before Summer League started.  I'll get into seating a little later but there are two types of tickets: one is basically a GA where you don't get assigned seating and the other you get reserved seating in the lower levels along one of the sidelines.  I think GA runs about $40/day (before taxes and fees) and Reserved Seating is $140/day (before taxes and fees).  We splurged and got RS.  If you want to make sure you're getting the best seats (i.e. closest to the action and sitting near NBA people) then you want to get tickets as soon as they came out.  You choose where you want to sit but for some reason when I bought tickets, my online purchases wouldn't go through and I had to call the order in.  The ticket gets you access to every game for that day but it's important to note that RS only gets you assigned seating for games played in the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.  Games played at the Cox Pavilion are all GA (more on this later).

**Gameday Experience**

We would take a Lyft or Uber everyday to the games.  It's about a 15 minute drive from the Encore, where we stayed and it's even closer if you're more south on the Strip like at the MGM Grand.  There's a designated drop off area and then you walk a couple of minutes to the arena.  

It's pretty nice that you get to watch all the games with your ticket.  The T&amp;M Center and Cox Pavilion are connected so you can shuttle back and forth as you please.  As I mentioned before, Cox is entirely GA so you have to do a little bit of planning ahead.  We couldn't get into the Magic/Celtics game because it was packed which was a little bit of a bummer since that was our only opportunity to watch Jalen Suggs and the Magic.  So for other games we wanted to watch there, especially ones we thought a lot of people wanted to see (i.e. the Hornets and LiAngelo Ball), we made sure to get there early so we could get seats.  It's a little bit chaotic but it actually worked a lot better than I thought it would.

The games go by relatively quick, although it's still a pain to sit through timeouts, fouling, and free throws at the ends of games.  But it's only about 8-10 minutes inbetween games so you're not waiting a long time for the next game to get started.

Probably because it's a smaller arena, but the energy for the games in Cox Pavilion was way higher.  They closed off the entire upper level of the T&amp;M Center so it didn't get as loud as it could.  Not sure if that was because of COVID or if they do that every year.

There's a few other things that are going on around the arena aside from the games themselves.  There were autograph sessions with Gary Payton and Nate Robinson, some carnival-type games, and podcasts/radio shows that were being recorded.  The TopShot stuff that was going on ended the day before we got there, so I can't opine on that unfortunately.  Looked cool though.

**Non-Gameday Experience**

I wanted to talk about this separately because it was sort of an experience in itself to be in Vegas with so many players, coaches, staff, and other NBA-related personnel.  There were a few teams also staying at the Wynn/Encore so we'd see NBA people all the time.  Right after we checked in we saw Jaylen Brown chopping it up with a few guys.  We didn't talk to or interrupt anyone as we didn't really want to bother them.  Actually, we didn't really see any fans going up to players in the hotel.  No pictures or autographs.  It was nice they were able to kind of do their thing without anyone bothering them because they definitely stand out.  I say ""kind of"" because it was clear these guys (especially the established players) are always on alert and their eyes are scanning around expecting people to go up to them.  But it was cool seeing them in a social environment and not being mobbed.  Especially at night after the games were done for the day, you'd see everyone just hanging out at the tables or bars, just having a good time.

**Random Sightings/Observations**

I'm not sure if anyone would find these particularly interesting but some might so I'll just run through them real quick.  I'm just listing them as I think of them so sorry if it's all over the place.

* Like I said before, I think a few NBA teams were staying at the Wynn/Encore.  We saw the Knicks, Pelicans, Hornets, and Jazz at least.  The Raptors and Grizzlies might've been staying there too.
* We saw Robert Covington a few times and each time he was just walking around by himself.  One time he was just sitting alone at an empty blackjack table at Resorts World on his phone.
* At the T&amp;M Center, sit in section 107 if you want to be near where all the players sit.  We sat there the first day.
* John Wall came for the Rockets/Raptors game and looks like he could lose a few pounds.  I know he's not the slimmest guy in general though so maybe that's just how his body is.
* Saw Shaq talking to the front desk about something.  I know it's not shocking but the guy is massive.  I think he DJ'd at one of the night swims at the hotel on Wednesday night.
* Chet Holmgren was at the games on Thursday.  He is a legit 7-footer.  Not that many people seemed to recognize him though.  He was walking around by himself trying to get a cab or something.  Clearly found one though because we saw him later at night hanging out with Scottie Barnes and some girls.  Which made me wonder what a bunch of guys who aren't 21 yet can do at night in Vegas.  We saw Scottie a few times at night in the hotel just hanging out.
* Speaking of Scottie, he is a big boy.  Definitely seems like he'll be able to hold his own physically in the league.  He's not the most ripped but you are starting to see some definition in his arms.
* LaMelo and Lonzo were there on Thursday for the Hornets game supporting their brother.  I think LaMelo had already gone to a few games at the point but not sure about Lonzo.  LaMelo was on his phone a lot but Lonzo pretty much focused on the game or was talking to one of his boys.
* LaVar and his wife sat in their own area away from the crowds and went to every Hornets game.  LaVar didn't do anything noteworthy.  They were just there as supportive parents.
* The crowd LOVED LiAngelo.  It looked like he was really trying out there though and we found ourselves getting caught up in the energy and rooting for him hard.  LaVar seemed to get a kick out of the crowd's support.
* Last thing about the Ball's: they really seem like a close-knit family.  At halftime of the Hornets/Spurs game, LaMelo and Lonzo went straight to their parents and hung out with them.  LaMelo especially was spending time with their mom and just really being affectionate with her.  It was really sweet to see.
* Didn't really see many people (players, coaches, or otherwise) gambling too much.  The only person I could recognize was Grayson Allen cashing in some chips.
* We didn't see many teams hanging out together as a group.  The only time I can remember really was seeing 6-7 guys from the Knicks hanging out together on Friday night.  Doesn't mean others weren't, was just the only time I saw it.
* Immanuel Quickley is a legit 6'3.
* Liz Cambage is a legit 6'8.  She also used hand sanitizer at every possible opportunity.  Weird observation I know but something I noticed since there were hand sanitizer dispensers all around.
* Players would constantly order Uber Eats or DoorDash or some sort of food delivery.  Always saw guys picking up food from a delivery person.
* Dwayne Casey sat near us during the Pistons/Lakers game.  He seems like a really nice guy.
* We saw Mike D'Antoni a few times and he was always talking on his phone.  Even this morning at 545am as we were waiting for our Lyft to the airport, we saw him in the lobby talking on his phone.
* We got to the Blazers/Pacers game some time in the first half and the first thing we saw was Michael Beasley yelling at Kenneth Faried (they were teammates).
* There's not much to really say about it but I'd remiss if I didn't mention anything.  The energy in the crowd for the Lakers/Pistons game went to another level when LeBron and Russ showed up.  Fans around the arena kept trying to get LeBron's attention.  He acknowledged at least one group from what I can remember.

That's about all I can remember for now but I'll add stuff in the comments if there's anything else or I'll try and answer some questions.  Hope some of you found this interesting.",NBA Summer League Recap

1327,nba,"Instead of replacing the lottery with a tournament as I've seen suggested, the NBA should create a postseason tournament for lottery teams that offers the winner their choice between doubling their current pick's odds OR an additional lottery selection. 

This incentivizes teams outside the playoff picture to field competitive teams with a chance at greatly improving their lottery odds. If the team with the 7th best lottery odds wins the tournament and doubles their chance at the lottery, they'd have better odds than the team with the worst record.

Doubling your odds at the bottom of the lottery wouldn't mean much, so those teams can choose to receive an additional pick at the end of the lottery. This would also be necessary option for a team that doesn't own their own lottery pick.

I think the layout would either be a conventional tournament with best of 3 or 5 game series played in home/away format, or a weeklong single-elimination tournament in a neutral location. 

The format will determine how much revenue the tournament generates, but in theory I'd incentivize the players with prize money for each series or the winner of single elimination. The players get a chance at more money, the league increases revenue, the team gets an improved or additional asset, and fans get more games.

######**TIER 1: THE TOP BANANAS**

*At the top of the trifle, Rachel added some sliced bananas. There's no doubt that these three teams represent (at least, at this stage) the top bananas in the NBA.*

--

**(3) LOS ANGELES LAKERS**

*last year*: There was definitely a title hangover to the Lakers' 2020-21 season. In fact, Anthony Davis barely showed up. The team finished a disappointing 42-30 and needed to win a play-in game to crack the field. And any hope that the team could simply flip a switch in the playoffs didn't work, as AD got hurt again and the team fell 4-2 to the Phoenix Suns. To Frank Vogel's credit, the team maintained their # 1 rank on defense despite a slew of injuries.

*losses*: LeBron James is not the type of player/shadow-GM to take a loss like that lying down. The team shed starting PG Dennis Schroder, starting SG Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and top rotation players like Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, and Markieff Morris. That change should be felt in the regular season; in fact, Schroder, Kuzma, KCP, and Harrell were actually the top 4 on the team in terms of total minutes played.

*gains*: LeBron James and Anthony Davis should be healthier than last year (when they combined to play 81 regular season games), which will be an immediate help. More help is on the way in the form of Russell Westbrook. Love him or hate him, he'll give you everything he's got for 35 minutes a night. The team added disparate pieces around their new ""Big 3,"" with some young guns like Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk, and some savvy vets like Wayne Ellington, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard, and LeBron's buddy Carmelo Anthony. 

*projected record*: The Westbrook trade was polarizing, but to me it indicates two things about LeBron James. 1) He's acknowledging that he needs a great deal of rest in the regular season and needs someone like Westbrook to help carry the team during those lulls. And 2) He trusts himself (and Rich Paul) to recruit bargain free agents that can replace the KCPs and Alex Carusos of the world. That latter part may be hit or miss. The Lakers' perimeter defense may have been their most underrated quality during their title run, so going from that to Westbrook and Wayne Ellington should be a downgrade on that end. I don't anticipate a major shift in the regular season record, so **52-30** sounds realistic. The bigger question is how the Lakers will do in the playoffs. Presuming they go small with AD at the 5 when it matters most, they'll still need someone else to step up on the wing. If I'm a Lakers fan, I need one of the young players to be that guy, be it Nunn, Monk, or Talen Horton-Tucker. One of the 3 needs to step up and become a reliable 6th man scorer. The trouble is: LeBron James has never had much patience for growing pains in the past. If the Lakers don't trust the youngsters and over-rely on over-the-hill veterans like Trevor Ariza and Carmelo Anthony to play major minutes instead, then I'd like their chances less. Overall I'm going with a *15%* title odds based on the greatness of LeBron James and Anthony Davis alone, but honestly I may have gone even higher if the team simply ran it back from last year.

---

**(2) MILWAUKEE BUCKS**

*last year*: The Milwaukee Bucks showed that it's possible to sleep on a 2-time top seed and a 2-time defending MVP. Their solid 46-26 regular season felt like a snoozer because it wasn't as good as the years before, and Giannis Antetokounmpo didn't even crack the top 3 in MVP as a result (I would have had him # 2 behind Nikola Jokic personally.) Come playoff time, the Bucks proved all the skeptics wrong, starting out with a smashing sweep of Miami and rolling all the way to the NBA title. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't without some good luck, but it's still a fitting reward for a team that's been awesome the last three seasons.

*losses*: The Bucks will roll it back with almost the exact same roster from last year. The most notable absence will be P.J. Tucker, who came on to play 29.6 minutes per night in the playoffs. To me, that's not a bad loss. The media loves Tucker, but he hasn't found his shot lately and hasn't been a major factor on the court. The team may actually be better off without him in the regular season.

*gains*: Milwaukee traded for SG Grayson Allen, a decent player who will also help their goal of collecting every white SG in the league. George Hill is back to play backup PG; even at age 35, he should be solid in that role. The team also added some wing depth like Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye, although ideally young players like Jordan Nwora would beat them out for minutes.

*projected record*: Despite taking a slight step back last year in terms of record, Milwaukee may be the best bet to win 60 games this year. They're a well-oiled machine that can cruise to **55-27** in their sleep. For them, the playoffs will be the only thing that matters. They're going to have to kill off the few holdover skeptics by beating a healthy Brooklyn Nets (and potentially the Lakers as well), and they'll have a good chance of doing that. I'm marking them down for a *20%* chance of a repeat. To make that happen, they need to hope that either Grayson Allen or Donte DiVicenzo can be that reliable 4th scorer. They managed to win despite DiVicenzo's injury last year, but the bar could be even higher this year.

---

**(1) BROOKLYN NETS**

*last year*: How good are the Brooklyn Nets? They were basically on cruise control last season and still went 48-24. How good at the Brooklyn Nets? They almost beat the eventually champion Bucks despite losing Kyrie Irving and despite James Harden looking like a shell of himself. If there's any concern here, it's the fact that their defense ranked # 23 overall and will lose top assistant Ime Udoka to boot.

*losses*: Aside from Udoka, OC Mike D'Antoni won't return either. Those may not seem like notable losses, but a brain drain like that can have an effect in the long term. On the court, there's not much of note. Former Nets core members like Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert, and Jarrett Allen barely played for the team last year. Departing veterans Jeff Green (27.0 MPG) and Landry Shamet (23.0 MPG) played quite a bit more and will represent moderate losses to the rotation.

*gains*: Arguably, the Nets' rotation will take an upgrade. Olympic hero Patty Mills will help back up Kyrie Irving, and cage fighter James Johnson will add some punch to the frontcourt. There are a few other new deep pieces of note: PG Jevon Carter is a good defender, DeAndre' Bembry can be a minutes-filler, and rookie Day'Ron Sharpe (UNC) could join the rotation down the road. But among the lesser names, rookie Cam Thomas (LSU) is the most intriguing. He's a mad bomber who will remind you of Jordan Clarkson. 

*projected record*: For Brooklyn, it's all a matter of health. Even if they coast through the regular season, they can still go **56-26**. For them, the goal will be to make the playoffs healthy. Because if Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin Durant all play at 100%, the Nets should be the prohibitive favorite to win the title. If you could *guarantee* that health, then I may even take them against the field. But pragmatically, we can't count on any of those ""Big 3"" to be at 100% come playoff time. For that reason, I'll downgrade their chances to *30%*. More than anything, I'd want to see that James Harden can enter the year and be the same iron horse that he'd been in the past. If he can sustain that level, then the team would be a top 3 contender even with an injury to Irving.","NBA LAYER CAKE: ranking all the teams, ending at the top 3"

Teoman was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but moved to Slovenia with his family as a kid. Note: it was all part of Yugoslavia back in the day. After Yu countries became independent, Alibegovic started playing for Slovenia and it is team's leading scorer with 990 points in 52 games . Luka D has 357 in 19 games, according to wiki.

There are many more arguments to be made ontop of this such as playmaking, carrying worse players and having to constantly go up against arguably the best team of all time in his conference.

However, I acknowledge there is a large gap in the defense, but even then its not like we are comparing Trae Young to a defensive anchor like Embiid, the gap between Harden and Wades defense isn't enough to overshadow the offensive gap.","D Wade is ""greater"" than Harden, but Harden is the better player"

Personally I believe **RJ Barrett** currently is underrated and has potential to become a top 20 player. The biggest knocks on him when he was drafted was his defense, shooting and potential playmaking - all of which he has shown immense growth but he doesn't play flashy/isn't as efficient, hence why people aren't thinking about him as that kind of prospect.",What young player do you think isn't currently widely talked about but you see as being a future top 20 player?

Why do I have so much belief in him? It's very simple actually. I believe his skillset is perfect for today's league.

People are too enamored about age when it comes to rookies but the old dogs still have some new tricks. Mitchell is elite at multiple things. An absolutely elite on ball defender, elite passer and pick and roll runner, elite ball handler and shotmaker. Out of all these traits shotmaking has been the most controversial but I look at his form, confidence and his clutch ability I know for sure the shooting will translate.

He also has excellent physical attributes. Very sturdy body, extremely quick and agile which makes him an excellent finisher and on ball defender.

What I like most though is his mentality. There is a clear difference when you hear this guy talk vs other rookies. The other rookies are excited, Energetic, and want to show everyone what they can do. Davion is a bit different. He's like a ruthless businessman. The way he approaches basketball is in a very matter of fact manner and you can see it in his interviews. He is also probably super excited to showcase his abilities but he's not going to showcase his emotions. He's here for business and wants to perform and win first and foremost. He has that mental edge over other rookies and that steely determination already makes him a mental veteran. For example look at the effort he puts on defense in the summer league. Dude is going crazy on man to man Showing full effort. I feel like his Mentality is Ja Morant + Jimmy Butler but slightly lesser aggression.

It's a no brainier that a complete skillset, steely mentality and great physical attributes makes him very likely to be successful in the NBA.",Why I believe Davion Mitchell will be a HUGE success in the NBA.

Contenders
1.One of the spurs young players in Murray Keldon or Lonnie walker, I feel they are in line for more minutes and one can truly breakout to all star level production this year.Keldon and walker more so cuz I expect them to have a higher scoring ceiling than Murray which usually ends up being value more for almost all Nba awards.
2.MPJ- one can argue he aalready broke out last yr but to me he has another scoring gear imo,bcoz he is prolly in line for 18 odd shots a game without murray and I am confident will lead the Nuggets in scoring
3.Darius Garland- I think he is the better prospect than sexton and if Sexton is traded Garland should very well be averaging 20/8 on like 40 from 3


4.Not actualy MIP canditates but all of these are coming of injury and I think can break out
JJJ- I see him having more playing time as a 5 and should be inline for a great season as a strech big offensively and bam esque anchor on defense.
Jonathan Isaac - I feel he was already DPOY calibre defensively before being injured and should have more scoring chances to improve offensively to upto perhaps 17-18 ppg.
Markelle Fultz- hope he finally figures out his shot and average 20ppg. I think he can be the Magics long term SG


Outside contenders
Kyle kuzma- Memes aside,he can be 18-20 ppg guy on good efficiency imo..and his shooting is passable for a 4 and should have more shots once Bradley beal is traded which Iexpect to happen before trade deadline
One of Charlottes wings/Pf in PJ washinton Bridges or Kelly oubre if like seasons before Hayward goes down injured yet again, if one of them gets the shot they would be able toaverage close to 20ppg in what iexpect to be a fun offense for the Hornets",NBA most Imrpoved player takes

1530,nba,"Not too long ago, I had a brief vacation to Portland, Maine. While there, I sent a good friend of mine, a resident of Oregon and big Trailblazer's fan, a jestful text about being in Portland, and that we should catch a game. Immediately, it sparked a thought in me, wondering whether that was possible for every team in the league. Over the next couple days, I contemplated it, occasionally looking one up, just to satisfy a curiosity. But, eventually the dam broke, and after a talk with said Blazers fan, I convinced myself to solve it once and for all, and as a Computer Science student with a little too much time on their hands, let's make the computer do it. 

However, I had one concern: I didn't wanna have to reorganize all the divisions, and possibly have a massive imbalance of locations. I gave the likenesses one stipulation, each swap must be to a city of the same name, but in a state that already had an NBA Team. Meaning the Trailblazers couldn't move to Maine, as the Augusta Lobsters have yet to leave my alternate fantasy reality, and join the NBA. I also had to make sure that states only got as many new teams as they had old ones. We'd be putting only one new team in Oregon, but we'd put four back in California.

After hours of doing maths out on paper, reading my notes on algorithms from previous classes, ~~StackOverflow~~, and devising a backtracking technique to pick a unique place in every row of a 30x30 matrix, I had a godless python script, and my answers in a text document. 

It wasn't a perfect job, but without further ado, here are the results: 

(Top to bottom is ordered by least alternative city-name options, to most.)

1. **Indianapolis Pacers** move from Indiana, to  Indianapolis, Oklahoma. Your new home town has a population of zero, and the only other place with the name Indianapolis in the US or Canada.
2. **~~New~~ Orleans Pelicans** move from Louisiana, to Orleans, Massachusetts. We've dropped the New, because it's implied in the ""New England"" bit. Pelicans aren't native to the cape... but did make the news after they stopped by during a hurricane. It's as good a pretense as any to name a team. 
3. **Orlando Magic** move from Florida, to Orlando, North Carolina. Despite being labelled as a ""populated place"" on the only sources of its existence I could find, said population doesn't seem to be an easy metric to find. Maybe they can do some magic and populate the place.
4. **Los Angeles Clippers** move from California, to Los Angeles, Texas. However, I struck luck gold for this, and there are TWO Los Angeles, Texas'. The Clippers get the boring one in Willacy County, a Census-Designated-Place with 121 residents.
5. **Los Angeles Lakers** move from California, to Los Angeles, Texas. They, on the other hand, get the Los Angeles in La Salle county. Much like Lebron to the Lakers, the city's namesake was a Promotional Stunt. 
6. **Milwaukee Bucks** move from Wisconsin, to Milwaukee, Pennsylvania. The only real information of note about Milwaukee, PA is that its' elevation of 935 is 318 feet higher than Milwaukee, WI
7. **Sacramento Kings** move from California, to Sacramento, Illinois. Sorry to Kings fans, but this place barely exists at all. It was by far the shittiest o the Sacramento's, but only fitting for the Shittiest of California teams. 
8. **Utah Jazz** move from Utah, to Indiana. Now, I know their city is technically Salt Lake City... but there is only one of those. And they're called the *Utah* Jazz, so it's only fair to find a place named Utah. They're now at least a little closer to the actual birthplace of Jazz, at least.
9. **Golden State Warriors** move from California, to San Francisco, Minnesota. I'm jumping back to using the city name, because there's no way in hell I was gonna be able to find another ""Golden State"". We'll see if Minnesota can live up to the reputation of being the second most populated place of white people claiming they loved Curry before it was cool, behind the United Kingdom.
10. **Minnesota Timberwolves** move from Minnesota, to Minnesota, California. As long as we allow the same grace we gave Utah, then we get a beautiful case of the Timberwolves and Warriors simple switching states! The wolves will be right at home at the base of Mt. Shasta.
11. **New York Knicks** move from New York, to New York, Florida. This place barely has a Wikipedia article, But luckily, despite leaving the ever bustling street economy of New York, the Knicks will still be surrounded by Panhandlers.",What if every team in the NBA switched to another city of the same name... but kept all the divisions even.

1533,nba,"I‚Äôve been listening to the Whistler Blower podcast (about Donahue) and they were discussing the game. I remember it being egregious and thinking it was rigged when I watched it live. I also hate the Lakers and love a good conspiracy theory, so I thought it would be fun to revisit and try to be impartial and‚Ä¶ I totally changed my mind. Now, I did only rewatch the 4th quarter because that is the most complained about, so maybe I missed some context, but for the most part, it wasn‚Äôt nearly what I remembered. Not that it would excuse bad calls if that was the case, but the Kings still had a million chances. In defense of the Kings, I thought Pollard‚Äôs last two fouls were a total joke and Bibby was obviously fouled by Kobe at the very end, but I don‚Äôt think the refs were the main reason the Kings lost. Am I missing something? A few notes‚Ä¶

- Bibby and Divac missed back to back gimmies at one point
- Peja missed two free throws and was completely absent the entire quarter. Don‚Äôt think he made a shot. 
- Webber committed his blatant 6th foul right before Divac got his 6th (which, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have called, but it wasn‚Äôt crazy)
- The refs had so many chances to call the 6th on Webber way before they did had they really wanted to rig it. I also constantly hear so many claim (even the podcast mistakenly does) that all 3 of the Kings big men (Pollard, Divac and Webber) fouled out. Webber never did. Doesn‚Äôt change anything about the game, but maybe shows the memory of the game is a bit too jaded. 
- Part of the foul disparity was the Kings intentionally fouling a ton at the end.",Was the ‚Äò02 WCF between the Kings and Lakers really rigged?

I wanted to vote Curry but I thought it might be a homer pick. Giannis was my 3rd choice. Trae Young is my dark horse for it.

DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo

Usuals will be up here: Draymond, Simmons, Gobert but I think Giannis will get it. Potentially he coasts throughout the season though. Dark Horse: Myles Turner. If he can stay healthy he can average 3+ blocks a game.

6MOY: Derrick Rose

Jordan Clarkson will be up there again, and I think Patty Mills will also be there. Dark Horses: Jordan Poole and Tyler Herro

ROTY: Cade Cunningham

Unsurprising. Number 1 ROTY. I think Green will start off stronger but by the end of the season I think Cade will get it. Suggs will also be up there and so will Davion Mitchell.  Dark Horse: Alperen Sengun

MIP: MPJ

With Murray down MPJ will get more shots as the second option on the Nuggets. If he can go from 19 to 26/27 he could win it. Some other shouts are T Mann and Reggie Jackson. With Kawhi going down they will have a larger offensive role and if they can continue their playoff form, they both have a chance. Dark Horse: Jordan Poole (homer pick ngl)

COTY: Frank Vogel (Lakers)

Even with Lebron coasting, Westbrook will get the Lakers a good record when he‚Äôs got shooters. Lebron and AD still win games. Monty Williams (Suns) and Mike Budenholzer (Bucks) and Steve Nash (Nets) will also be up there. Dark Horse: Nate McMillan (Hawks)

Exec of the year: Marc Eversley (Bulls GM)

If the Bulls end up being good (top 5 seed) it will be mainly due to the roster moves - the acquisition of Demar, Lonzo and CaruGoat. Andy Elisburg (Heat GM), Scott Perry (Knicks GM) and Rob Pelinka (Lakers GM) are my other choices. Dark Horse: IDK, maybe Bob Myers (Warriors GM) if OPJ and Bjelica stay healthy and reach peak form and Kuminga and Moody come good. Also a chance of a major trade.

2012 - Heat - Superteam

2011 - Mavs - the only case where a loyal player won a title on the hardest road possible.

1643,nba,"I see the term demigod thrown out a lot to describe Kevin Durant after he goes off on an opponent. It got me thinking about what other NBA players would be worthy of the demigod label. If the NBA was Greek Mythology, what would be the god for each basketball skill or component.

A demigod seems to be a current or potential tier 1 player with a skillset or natural frame that is seen by others to be beyond advantageous and unteachable. 

Kevin Durant seems to claim the Scoring God thrown (As his frame is not only unique, the way he can control it is more so), LeBron would be the Zeus of the Basketball Mythos (Doesn't matter what player he is photographed with, his body seems to morph so he is just as tall or taller). Who would be the Defensive Demigod? Rudy Gobert is good, but you can't say his defense is equalivalent to Durant's scoring prowess or LeBron's overall aura. Plus no one can argue him a tier 1 player. Victor Wembenyama seems to be a player that has POTENTIAL to be that tier 1 player while also a dominant DPOY.

1646,nba,"Rob Pelinka is often too credited for his signings but is overlooked how bad of a GM he really is.

He opted to not bring back Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Dwight Howard after the Lakers won in 2020.

The way he lost Danny Green was by trading him for Dennis Schr√∂der who in turn was a disaster for them and lost him for nothing. Danny Green would solve problems the Lakers had in 2021 and will have in 2022.

He opted for Montrezl Harrell and Marc Gasol (great guy but washed up) over Dwight and McGee and they became unplayable in the playoffs.

Rondo was a great backup playmaker and they let him go for free. Avery Bradley was their best backcourt defender and they opted to let him go for free too.

We then saw what happened in 2021 without some of those guys and they lost in the First Round.

Now, he loses Caruso (a valuable piece), Kuzma (who was coming into his own as an off the ball player and defender), and KCP (their 3rd most valuable player). Morris was also a valuable player.

Now their title hopes rest in trusting a me-first, stat padding point guard in Westbrook. He better hope he and LeBron work these next couple of years (it 99% won't work).

KCP, Green, Bradley, Rondo, Caruso, McGee, Morris, Kuzma, and Howard (he's back but it's not enough) would've been the answer in 2021. Not Schr√∂der, Trezz, Drummond, and Gasol and they sure as hell would be the answer heading into 2022. Not Westbrook, Carmelo, Ariza, Bazemore, and Ellington.

At just 24 years old, Devin Booker already having 15 20+ quarters is absurd. He has really proven himself as one of the best heat check guys in the NBA, which we saw in his 4 40 point playoff performances in his first postseason. 

Zach Lavine also has an impressive appearance on this list, tied with Allen Iverson and KD for 10th with 10 20+ point quarters.

1676,nba," In 1979 the Cavs traded their first round pick to the Lakers for Don Ford (absolutely baffling move, the guy averaged just under 7 a game for LA year that year) and ended up with the worst record in the league during the 1982 season. Since this was pre-lottery this meant the order at the top of the draft would be decided by a coin toss between the Lakers (via the Cavs pick) and Clippers (worst record in the Western Conference). The defending champ Lakers won the toss, giving them the perfect opportunity to build around Kareem and Magic while the Clippers lost, using their second pick to get Terry Cummings (quality player, but they whiffed on Dominique who went third....).

As far as I can tell, this sequence of events is pretty much unique in NBA history.

For whatever reason, the Bulls didn't offer Butler the supermax, they supposedly thought building around Butler would lead to mediocrity.

1708,nba,"Using the shot type data on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com), I plotted points per game and field goal percentage for the five most common shot types: catch-and-shoot attempts, drives, pull-up jumpers, post-ups, and paint catches (lobs, etc). 

**Catch and Shoot Scoring Chart:** 

[**https://i.imgur.com/pLxrY6S.png**](https://i.imgur.com/pLxrY6S.png)

I'm pretty sure nobody (besides maybe the most ardent Magic and Bulls fans) would have predicted Nikola Vucevic lapping the field in catch-and-shoot volume, but here he is, cementing his spot as the league's premier stretch 5. 

Joe Harris leads the league in efficiency, shooting at an impressive 52% clip on high volume and challenged by just Clippers floor-spacer Marcus Morris Sr. and his Nets teammate Kevin Durant. Harris does attempt more three-pointers than his two competitors, though ‚Äî his three-point attempt rate of .628 outpaces Morris's .503 and doubles up Durant's .313 ‚Äî so he's scoring more efficiently on deeper shots, an impressive feat. 

Harris's efficiency is also far-and-away above that of players in similar roles, such as Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Though the gravity of Brooklyn's three superstars certainly provides Harris quite a few open looks, he's the most effective player of his archetype in the league. 

At the low end, we see a few struggling stretch 4s: Christian Wood, Kevin Love, and Jaren Jackson Jr. This isn't all that surprising ‚Äî Love's struggles in Cleveland last year are well-documented, Wood had a hard time shooting the ball after a white-hot start when he missed time with an ankle injury, and  Jackson Jr. really couldn't find his shot in a small sample size at the end of the year when he returned from a meniscus tear. 

**Drive Scoring Chart:** 

[**https://i.imgur.com/FXHZGXl.png**](https://i.imgur.com/FXHZGXl.png)

Giannis immediately pops off the page here: his pretty-high volume combined with a dominant shooting percentage approaching 65% put him in a league of his own. 

In the next tier are four extremely-high-volume drive scorers, listed here in order of efficiency: Luka Doncic, De'Aaron Fox, SGA, and Bradley Beal. Their efficiency ranges from elite (Luka) to merely above-average (Beal), but all four players average over 12 points per game on drives before even accounting for free throws, making them clearly the league's top driving options. 

There are three other tiers of quality scorers past those five stars. First, the low-volume-but-extremely-efficient group: LeBron James (yep), Kevin Durant (yep), Jalen Brunson (?), and Eric Gordon (???). 

Then, there's the high-volume-not-very-efficient group. If free throws were included, some of these guys with high free-throw rates would definitely move up the list in efficiency (Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Ja Morant) while others who struggle to get to the line would remain below league average efficiency (Caris LeVert and somewhat Donovan Mitchell, though his FTr isn't all that bad).

Finally, there's a tier of players who seem primed to join the top five but just aren't quite there yet: the good-volume, good-efficiency group. This is just about exactly who you'd expect: Zion, Kyrie, James Harden, and DeMar DeRozan, four All-Star-to-All-NBA caliber scorers. 

**Pull-Up Jumper Scoring Chart:**

[**https://i.imgur.com/GFradcd.png**](https://i.imgur.com/GFradcd.png)

Steph Curry, CJ McCollum, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic are in a tier of their own when it comes to volume scoring off the dribble. Just behind them are about the players you would expect: Durant, Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving all shoot a higher percentage on fewer attempts, while Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine and Jamal Murray shoot a similar percentage at slightly lower volume. 

This chart, though, might be the most misleading when it comes to field goal percentage. Since off-the-dribble jumpers have the most disparate difficulty range of these six shot types, the FG% axis isn't a great representation of who's more efficient ‚Äî eFG% would be a much better measure, but even that wouldn't capture the difference in degree of difficulty between Damian Lillard's three-pointers and, say, Russell Westbrook's mostly-uncontested triples. 

This results in an inaccurate representation of efficiency ‚Äî for example, I'm willing to bet that despite DeMar DeRozan's elite placement on this chart, he probably isn't the #1 most efficient jump shooter in the league; instead, his diet of midrange jump shots is more makeable than, say, Steph Curry's routine of off-balance treys. This makes the y-axis nearly meaningless, so we can take most of this plot with a grain of salt. 

The volume axis is still pretty useful, though. It gives a good idea of the off-dribble jumper scoring tiers beyond the top guys ‚Äî as we move to the left along the x-axis, the list of names features mostly high-volume scorers (Tatum, Devin Booker, Kawhi and PG) along with some second options who just really like shooting off the dribble (D'Angelo Russell, Kemba Walker).

And down at the *very* bottom of the chart, despite what I said about FG% being misleading, the names are still about who you'd expect. Only seven players shoot below 35% on pull-up jumpers: Giannis, John Wall, Victor Oladipo (three scorers not exactly known for their knockdown jumpers), Devonte Graham, Anthony Edwards, Immanuel Quickley, and Kevin Porter Jr. (four younger guys taking lots of shots but still figuring out how to efficiently score). 

**Post Scoring Chart:**

[**https://i.imgur.com/GFradcd.png**](https://i.imgur.com/GFradcd.png)

So... Joel Embiid is really good. He scored almost nine points in the post per game on elite efficiency (the next closest player, Jokic, didn't even average six). There are four post scorers clearly a step above everyone else: Embiid (on extremely high volume), Jokic (on second-highest-in-the-league volume), and Jonas Valanciunas and Zion Williamson (on decent volume). 

After those guys, there's a tier of efficient scorers who just don't post up a lot: KD, Kawhi, Giannis, Tobias Harris, John Collins, and Thaddeus Young. There's also AD and Vucevic, who post up more frequently than anyone besides Embiid and Jokic but don't shoot a great FG% when they do. 

There's a whole clump of middling post-up guys ‚Äî your Domantas Sabonis/Al Horford/Melo tier ‚Äî and then, at the very bottom, Embiid's new frontcourt partner Andre Drummond rounds out the chart. Drummond is almost as big of a negative outlier in FG% as Embiid is a positive outlier in volume; he shoots below 41% while none of the dozens of other bigs on the plot even venture below 45%. 

**Paint Touch Scoring Chart:**

[**https://i.imgur.com/TgbVLLa.png**](https://i.imgur.com/TgbVLLa.png)

This plot actually turned out a lot more interesting than I was expecting. There's actually a pretty sizable difference in efficiency from guys you'd expect to just be rim-runners, showing that there's a lot more skill involved with rim gravity than simply catching the ball near the basket and dunking it; I personally also think the guard play on different teams has a pretty big effect on how effective players can be on their paint touches, but that's just how I see it. 

There are five guys who, volume-wise, are in a tier of their own: Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Jonas Valanciunas, Clint Capela, and Jarrett Allen. They combine to run the gamut of FG%, from Gobert's sizzling 73% (who would've guessed?!) to Capela's underwhelming 63% (generally, above 65% seems to be good, while up over 70% is elite). 

After those five, the list gets more interesting. Up in the elite-efficiency group, the expected names like Zion, Bam, Jokic, Giannis, and AD are joined by Thomas Bryant ‚Äî¬†who does have a small sample size due to his ACL tear ‚Äî and Mason Plumlee, along with up-and-comers like James Wiseman and Christian Wood. 

There are also some surprising names in the low efficiency group. Though Andre Drummond is unsurprisingly horrendous (one of just two players below 57%, with the other being PJ Washington), some stars known for their shooting touch make cameos below the 65% watermark: Embiid, KAT, and Vucevic. This does provide some evidence for my theory about guard play ‚Äî¬†none of those three players have floor generals capable of breaking down the defense and setting up easy finishes for their bigs in the vein of Chris Paul, Mike Conley, or Trae Young.

ennis Keith Rodman (born May 13, 1961) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed ""the Worm"",[2] he is known for his fierce defensive and rebounding abilities. Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Rodman played at the small forward position in his early years before becoming a power forward. He earned NBA All-Defensive First Team honors seven times and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. His biography at NBA.com states that he is ""arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history"". On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman's No. 10 jersey,[3] and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later that year.[4]

Rodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was shy and introverted in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a ""bad boy"" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many piercings and tattoos, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a wedding dress to promote his 1996 autobiography Bad As I Wanna Be. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer Madonna and was briefly married to actress Carmen Electra.

1753,nba,"At this point in the offseason, it's still too hard to come up with a clear and confident differentiation between teams. It may be easier to lump them together in ""tiers"" instead. Over the next week, we'll try to sort out those layers.

But since that's still an inexact and sloppy science, we'll equate it less like a perfect layer cake and more like Rachel Green's [trifle](https://www.bustle.com/articles/50944-how-to-make-rachels-thanksgiving-trifle-from-friends-how-to-survive-serving-it-photos) from *Friends.* It's muddled, it's messy, but it's something we're going to try and dig through anyway.

######**TIER 2: more CUSTARD / CREAM OF THE CROP**

*Towards the top of the trifle, Rachel put some more custard. In this case, it'll represent the cream of the crop. Top teams who have a tangible chance (albeit a small one) of winning the NBA championship. Towards that end, we'll rank them in terms of TITLE ODDS more so than regular season records.*

---


**(9) LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS**

*last year*: Despite an embarrassing combustion in the 2020 playoffs, the L.A. Clippers and coach Ty Lue decided to cruise through the regular season (47-25), knowing they had true title together if they could make the playoffs at full strength. The plan worked out perfectly... until they got hurt *in* the playoffs. The Kawhi-less cast hung on admirably, but ultimately fell 4-2 to Phoenix in the Conference Finals.

*losses*: The Clippers retained all the major pieces of their roster, but Kawhi Leonard's injury will cloud their entire season. Can he make it back for the playoffs? Does he even want to? Those questions make the team's fate almost impossible to project.

*gains*: The team added a couple of interesting draft prospects in the athletic Keon Johnson (Tennessee) and the high school stud Brandon Boston (Kentucky.) They also took a flier on Justise Winslow. I don't imagine any of those three will be major factors this next year unless things go wrong.

*projected record*: Paul George showed that he can carry this team to a pretty good result without Leonard around, so we can count on a solid **46-36** record. But again, it all comes down to Kawhi Leonard. If Leonard is actually going to play in the playoffs (at 100%), then this may be a true title contender. Personally, I felt that the Clippers had a top 3 roster in the league over the last two seasons. If Leonard didn't get hurt, they'd be in the top 3 again. Overall we'll give them a *4%* chance of winning the title because that return is feasible. I'd certainly bet against Leonard returning, but it's not impossible.

---

**(8) PHILADELPHIA 76ers**

*last year*: In his debut season with the team, Doc Rivers showcased his strong defensive schemes. The Sixers rose up to the # 2 defense and grabbed the top seed in the East. And in the playoffs, Doc Rivers showcased his playoff... uh... what's the opposite of acumen? Whatever it is, the team flopped and lost 4-3 to the upstart Atlanta Hawks in R2.

*losses*: It's hard to project the Clippers' season without knowing about Kawhi Leonard, and it's hard to project the Sixers' without knowing the fate of Ben Simmons. He's still on the roster right now, and there's a chance that Daryl Morey lets the tension die down and plays the start of the season out. At the moment, there's been hardly any changeover to the roster so far. Backup big Dwight Howard is gone after a pretty solid season (7.0 points, 8.9 rebounds in only 17.3 minutes.)

*gains*: Fallen star Andre Drummond will come in and soak up the Dwight Howard minutes. And while Drummond is a punching bag, he also represents solid insurance in case of a Joel Embiid injury. Rookies Jaden Springer (Tennessee) and Filip Petrusev (Serbia) were two of the more underrated prospects in my mind, but neither should expect rotational minutes this year.

*projected record*: We're all expecting a major shakeup at some point, but if that *doesn't* happen, it's not necessarily the worst thing in the world. I'd still expected a solid **48-34** record and at least a 3 seed out East. And as long as the Sixers can make the second round at full strength, then anything can happen in the playoffs. We can give them a *4.5%* chance of winning it all.

---

**(7) UTAH JAZZ**

*last year*: The league's *other* top seed, Utah actually had the NBA's best record overall at 52-20. Their advanced stats were even better than that. They finished # 1 in SRS, # 3 in offense, and # 4 in defense. Based on all those factors, they should have been a genuine title contender. Instead, they lost to the Clippers in round two.

*losses*: Backup Derrick Favors' return to Utah didn't go as well as planned. He only averaged 15 minutes a game, and got sent away after only one season.

*gains*: In Favors' place, the team added Hassan Whiteside. Like Andre Drummond, he's become vilified by fan bases, but he's certainly qualified to be a backup. Veteran Rudy Gay will also add some depth to the frontcourt. While Gay is more of a 15/20 minute player these days (at age 35), he's still productive in that role. In fact, Gay quietly averaged 19.0 points and 8.0 rebounds per 36 minutes last season.

*projected record*: The Jazz didn't end the season on a high note, but they're going to be among the best regular season teams in the league. Rudy Gobert's defense is still the most impactful in the game, and Quin Snyder's style of jacking up 3s (most in the league) is the smart way to play around him. I'm counting on a **52-30** record, and perhaps even better than that. Of course, after grabbing the 1 seed last year, the key is whether or not the Jazz can contend in the playoffs or not. I think they'll have a puncher's chance. Donovan Mitchell can get red hot and win a round or two. It's hard to imagine that happening in every single round though, which makes me think they'll probably peak in R2 or R3 again. We'll list them at *4.5%* to win the title, which is lower than their record would indicate.

---

**(6) DENVER NUGGETS**

*last year*: Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets had a great regular season, going 47-25 overall with a SRS power ranking that ranked # 6 in the NBA. Not only was Jokic a legitimate MVP, he probably should have won unanimously. Unfortunately, Jamal Murray got hurt, preventing the team from making a deep run in the playoffs. Phoenix sent them home 4-0 in round two.

*losses*: Jamal Murray's injury is still the biggest question mark on the team. Besides that, they didn't have many defections. PF Paul Millsap is still a free agent at the moment, although he's become more of a rotational player lately. Last season, he started 36/56 games and averaged 20.8 minutes a night.

*gains*: Veteran Jeff Green signed a two-year deal and will likely fill the void left behind by Millsap. Green may have been overrated early in his career, but he's reinvented himself as a solid depth player at PF and even smallball center. Rookie Nah'Shon ""Bones"" Hyland (VCU) has some scoring chops, but will likely only play extended minutes if Murray misses even more time than we expect.

*projected record*: It's really a shame that Murray got hurt, because the Denver Nuggets were shaping up into a possible title contender. They had some of the wind taken out of their sails when they lost Jerami Grant, but a midseason trade for Aaron Gordon helped bring that defensive spark back. At full strength, they may have been a threat for the top seed in the West. Without knowing Murray's future, we'll go with a solid **48-34** record, but an elevated *5%* chance at the title. The ""upside"" of the team is higher than Utah's in my opinion, given Murray's return and Michael Porter Jr.'s ascension. And the ""floor"" is also higher than the Clippers, because Murray's injury doesn't appear to be as serious as Kawhi Leonard's.

---

**(5) GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS**

*last year*: A few years after constructing the best team of my lifetime, the Warriors missed the playoffs for the second year in a row. Steph Curry led them to a 39-33 record and won MVP votes in the process, but they stumbled out of the play-in tournament. To their credit, the team played fast (3rd in pace) and played hard (5th in defense), but just didn't have enough talent to get the job done.

*losses*: Golden State will lose a few small pieces (Kent Bazemore, Eric Paschall, Nico Mannion), but Kelly Oubre stands out as the most impactful. Oubre shot poorly last year, but he was certainly a big piece of the team. He started 50/55 games, averaging 30.7 minutes and 15.4 points per game.

*gains*: Fortunately the Warriors have a pretty darn good 3+D guy coming back to replace him by the name of Klay Thompson. They also drafted two talented rookies in Jonathan Kuminga (G-League) and Moses Moody (Arkansas), both of whom have starting potential down the road. Vets Nemanja Bjelica and Andre Iguodala may also crack the rotation at some point or another. But honestly, the player that I'm most excited about (save Klay) is Otto Porter Jr. Porter's been injured and forgotten over the last few years, but he could be a major difference maker for the team. He has the height to guard 2-4, and he's a career 40.2% shooter from beyond the arc.

*projected record*: It's hard to know what the Warriors are getting with Klay Thompson. Steph Curry and Draymond Green are also over 30, and Otto Porter's got some glass parts himself. Given all that, there's a chance that injuries wreak havoc on this team and cause them to play their younger players more than they'd like. I'll pencil them in for a conservative **47-35** for that reason. That said, the upside of this team is undeniable. If Thompson can come back to form (or even 90% of his former self), and Otto Porter can be Harrison Barnes Lite, then the Warriors may be able to trot out a form of the ""Death Lineup"" once again and be a matchup nightmare in the playoffs. I'm giving them a healthy *7%* chance to win the title for that reason. Boom/bust.

---

**(4) PHOENIX SUNS**

*last year*: Even with the addition of Chris Paul, the Suns were projected to have a modest 38.5 wins by Las Vegas. They beat those expectations almost immediately, going 51-21. The doubters remained, but the Suns kept answering, marching all the way to the Finals. Overall, they finished top 3 in SRS, top 5 in offense, and top 10 in defense.

*losses*: The team brought back Chris Paul, which means the vast majority of the rotation will stay in tact. Last season addition Torrey Craig went to Indiana and Jevon Carter left for Brooklyn; both were underrated players, but neither cracked 20 MPG.

*gains*: James Jones and company made some small tweaks. They added Elfrid Payton and Landry Shamet to the backcourt, and big man / gold medalist JaVale McGee to the frontcourt. It'd be a surprise if any of them cracked 20 MPG either.

*projected record*: Although the Suns made the Finals, we can't pencil them in to the top 5 automatically. Consider this: the last four teams to make the Finals (Toronto, Golden State, L.A. Lakers, Miami) combined to win a grand total of ONE playoff series the following year. It's possible Phoenix could peak in R1/R2. Statistically, you can make the argument for a team like Utah over them. I'm even going to put their regular season numbers a little lower at **51-31**. So why are we still putting them in the top 4? Because to me the Suns still have some lingering upside that we haven't seen yet. Deandre Ayton is 23 -- Mikal Bridges is 24 -- Cam Johnson is 25. Heck, even Devin Booker is only 24. If those guys can use the Finals run as fuel to get better and better, the Suns may take another step up. I'd still rank them decidedly below the super teams, but an *8%* chance of a title is realistic.",NBA LAYER CAKE: ranking all the teams in the 4-9 range

Let‚Äôs looks at the T‚ÄôWolves. They have a top 30 player in KAT, a very promising rookie, and a decent cast of young players. They have gotten over their grief for the death of Flip by firing his son, and finally got what seems to be a real coach. They‚Äôre getting new ownership and it seems like there could be a new culture developing there. However, their success really depends on KAT because he is their future and their franchise. Everything about this team future is really unknown at this point but their new coach can turn things around. 

Then you have the Kings. They have a below average coach who is on the hot sit and probably will get fired if they‚Äôre not above .500 mid season. They have two potential all stars in Fox and Halliburton and a few unproven young talent. They‚Äôre team is not built very well but they have some pieces that could be flipped for something nice. Essentially though their in the same situation they‚Äôve been in for the past decade. 

So in my opinion I think the Wolves have a better chance in making the playoffs and that‚Äôs simply off their coaching hire. It is quite possible that the Kings put it all together and Walton turns things around. However, I find it highly unlikely because of the turmoil with two of their players(Heidl and Bagley) and Luke not really being a good coach.

New head coach of the Dallas Mavericks is re-entering the spotlight after new stories are emerging about his tenure as a coach for the Milwaukee Bucks. The tales can be found in a new biography about NBA Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo entitled Giannis: The Improbable Rise of an NBA MVP.

In his book, the Greek Freak recounts a number of high and lows in the 2017-2018 season, mostly due to Jason Kidd‚Äôs decisions and derisions. Kidd reportedly forced his players to miss their Christmas festivities over a loss to the Hornets.

He‚Äôs also reportedly obsessed with water parks and slides.

‚ÄúKidd had an unhealthy obsession with water parks and would eat lunch at Pelican Cove Water park 4 days a week,‚Äù said former player Tyler Zeller. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt enjoy water parks, but when someone is screaming at you to be his human inner tube for every ride in the park, you start to wonder what this has to do with basketball.‚Äù

‚ÄúBucks forward Khris Middleton thought Coach Kidd‚Äôs water park infatuation was a plot to get at single moms.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen Kidd‚Äôs team was down against the Chicago Bulls in crunch time Preparing his team for their next play, the coach turned his white board around and scribbled some lines and figures which ended up forming an artistic rending of a water park slide. The coach then asked his exhausted team: ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt this be a great water slide?‚Äù

OP: I initially heard these stories on the latest episode of Jalen and Jacoby, I was crying laughing and had to find the source. Not sure if this had been posted or if its true, but too funny to not be posted if it hadn‚Äôt already.",Jason Kidd really like water parks

However they end up in the lottery every year. From Rudy Gay to Tyrek Evans to Boogie and IT and now Fox, they‚Äôve had good NBA pieces to build around. They had good coaches like Mike Malone, George Karl and Joeger wasn‚Äôt too bad in Memphis.

1814,nba,"After watching ""Untold: Malice at the Palace"", it's pretty clear that the NBA , ESPN and the media went after the players much harder than they should've.

The players feel they could not get their voice out during the time and defend their actions.

O'Neal:

&gt;&gt;!""Everything I did, I had to do in protection. The narrative was based on an edited conclusion on ESPN. Not even a fair trial of it.""!&lt;

Artest:

&gt;&gt;!""I wish I could've been right after, because then people could've been like 'He is right' or 'He is wrong'. There could've been way more opinions. But the opinion was (based) only on film and the suspension, and we had to be quiet""!&lt;

The prosecutor of the case treated them much fairly in comparison.David Gorcyca, the prosecutor:

&gt;&gt;!""NBA was worried about their perception. Their image was tarnished, and the severity of the sanctions and the suspensions was pretty harsh. I think they wanted me to send the message to these millionaire-type bullies that 'hey, you cant be doing that.' But my job was to look at the facts and decide what the appropriate charges are.""!&lt;

He even defended Artest punching the fan who came on court:

&gt;&gt;!""One of them (fans) coming on the court face-to-face with Ron with a clenched fist. So Ron had every right to defend himself at that point.""!&lt;

He also added:

1816,nba,"But I don't know if there's any big man that shoots free throws like that. All of them hit the same arc height as if they were guards and I don't know why. Wouldn't it be easier to shoot free throws if you just learn to arc the ball higher so you can have a more natural shooting motion and can learn to sink free throws more easily?

I'm just thinking out loud, that's all. It just seems like tall players put themselves at a disadvantage by not arcing the shot higher in ratio with how much taller they are than some 6'5"" guards.","I always thought that if you're a big man, you would just shoot free throws in a higher arc but with the same shooting motion"

I know when we played LeBron when I coached Melo, Melo got fired up, he got into the game. When I was in Denver, we had a winning record against LeBron.

So I want to present a few exhibits.

**The talent level of the 3X3 basketball players**

The Latvian team won Gold Medal. This is their roster, including height, age, and most recent professional 5 on 5 basketball experience.

*Nauris Miezis (6'3, 30, 2.5 PPG in Baltic Basketball League in 2015)
*Karlis Lasmanis (6'7, 27, 9.8 PPG in Estonian-Latvian Basketball League in 2019)
*Edgars Krumins (6'5, 36, 10.4 PPG in Lithuanian Basketball league in 2016)
*Agnis Cavars (6'5, 35, 6.9 PPG in Lithuanian Basketball League in 2016)

**The silver medal Russia Team**

*Ilia Karpenkov (6'8, 24, 1.5 PPG in VTB Youth League in 2019)
*Aleksandr Zuev (6'4, 24, 8.1 PPG in FIBA 18 tournament in 2014)
*Stanislav Sharov (6'3, 26, couldn't find anything)
*Kirill Pisklov (6'4, 24, 11.9 PPG in FIBA U20 Tournament in 2016)

**and the Bronze Medal Serbian Team**
Mihailo Vasic (6'7, 28, 8.0 PPG in NCAA Division 2 in 2018)
Aleksandar Ratkov (6'4, 29, couldn't find his pro stats [but I found his page on Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/aleksandar-ratkov))
Dejan Majstorovic (6'6, 33, 8.0 PPG in Serbian KLS League in 2018)
Dusan Bulut (6'3, 35, 17 PPG currently in the Big 3, 4th in the League)

Dusan Bulut is the best data point to look at here because he's often looked at as the best 3X3 basketball player.

We can also look at the 3 box scores

[Game 1](https://big3.com/boxscore/?gameid=2365364)
[Game 2](https://big3.com/boxscore/?gameid=2369544)
[Game 3](https://big3.com/boxscore/?gameid=2370000)

So you can see a sense of the caliber of retired NBA players he was playing against.

I understand it is obviously a different format of basketball but competitive 3 on 3 hasn't been around long enough where there's some lifetime accumulation of skills where a 3X3 guy knows some secret to winning that can overcome an NBA player. Most of these guys just made the transition and adapted within the past few years because of how young this game is.

With all this being said, who still thinks Isaiah Thomas, someone who dropped double digit scoring in the NBA as early as last season, is not competitive enough to play Olympic 3X3 Basketball?

Anyway, this post is all about  Modern Era People/Players Vs Older Era People/Players.

I think most of us are aware of the ongoing beef between eras by some players/people.


Modern Era be like: 

"" The older generation were slow, small, unskilled""

"" The Older generation were trash"" 

"" The Older Generation cannot defend without wrestling""

"" The Older Generation cannot shoot as well as we are doing""

"" The Older Generation Teams just score 80-90 pts whole game. That is only after 3rd quarter today""

Older Era be like:

"" This new generation is soft as hell""

"" This new generation just chucking up threes""

"" This new generation forgot the art of post ups and midrange""

"" This new generation  are  just specialists""

"" It is so much easier to score now because of no hand checking""

"" This new generation do not play defense""


These made my head shaking. What a massive disrespect from both sides. I don't know who did it first, but they are being era-bias. 

Especially for the All Time Greats. I think any Consensus Top 10 or even Top 15 all time player will dominate in any era. 

But based on my personal opinion. Modern Era calling Older Era Unskilled, and Older Era calling Modern Era Soft are both wrongly wrong. 

For me, I appreciate each and every era. Especially the All time greats.

1840,nba,"With the NBA draft just concluded and Summer League ongoing, one of the most overlooked aspect of a prospect is their time of birth. Even for people born in the same year, their month of birth can play a huge role with people born in Feb and march enjoying a sizeable. This becomes much more pronounced in the lottery. This effect has only become more pronounced in the last decade. This might be due to the prospects getting younger and the AAU system which prefers more developed players at a younger age. Being born early confers that advantage too. Below is some data:

The only way I see him doing it when playing with Westbrook is if AD is load managing throughout the season. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt even do it until the post season so it doesn‚Äôt matter. Anyway would love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts.,Will AD actually play Centre

2015,nba,"At this point in the offseason, it's still too hard to come up with a clear and confident differentiation between teams. It may be easier to lump them together in ""tiers"" instead. Over the next week, we'll try to sort out those layers.

We already went through [Tier 6](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ozu67p/nba_layer_cake_ranking_all_the_teams_starting/) and now we'll take one step up.

######**TIER 3: THE BEEF: the meaty part of the playoff field**

*In the middle of her trifle, Rachel accidentally switched to a shepherd's pie and added beef. But that weightiness is fitting for us. This high-middle pack of teams can pack a serious punch and may threaten to win a playoff series.*

---

**(14) BOSTON CELTICS**

*last year*: The bloom is officially off the rose. After making the Conference Finals twice in three years, the young Celtics stagnated for the first time. They finished 36-36 and lost in round one. As a result, the team reshuffled their structure -- elevating Brad Stevens to GM and hiring Nets assistant Ime Udoka as the head coach.

*losses*: PG Kemba Walker never quite worked out in Boston and was shown the door. He's the biggest subtraction, but he's not the only one. The Celtics will also be without Tristan Thompson (who started 43/54 games) and Evan Fournier (who started 10/16 after coming over in midseason.) It's also notable that Daniel Theis had started 37 games prior to his midseason departure last year. All in all, that's a lot of lost starts for the team to figure out.

*gains*: The Celtics took advantage of a cold market for Dennis Schroder and brought him in on a team friendly deal. Schroder's reputation took a hit this past season, but he still averaged 15.4 points and 5.8 assists. He should be a positive contribution to the backcourt, whether he's starting or coming off the bench. It's hard to tell how much returning big man Al Horford has left to contribute after basically punting 2020-21 away, but he theoretically helps the depth down low. Enes Kanter will do the same, replacing Thompson. Josh Richardson will try to replace Evan Fournier on the wing, although his three-point shooting has been on a downward trend (38% to 36% to 34% to 33% last year.) 

*projected record*: The Celtics may be a forgotten team out East, but they still have the pieces to be a R2 contender. Cornerstones Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are a great start, but they'll need some help along the way. The key may be two young players: Aaron Nesmith and ""Timelord"" Robert Williams. Nesmith is a natural shooter and could be a helpful spacer; ideally, he'd outplay Richardson and grab a hold of 25 minutes a night. It'd be great if Robert Williams could do the same. He's a big time shot blocker with more juice in his legs than Horford. If those two guys can step up, the Celtics may be able to get back into the top half of the playoff bracket. If they can't, then the Celtics may be scraping and clawing in a play-in tournament.

---

**(13) PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS**

*last year*: It may feel like a distant memory, but Portland actually had a solid 42-30 record last year and beat out the Lakers for the 6th seed. That goodwill ended quickly ion the playoffs, as the Jamal Murray-less Nuggets brushed them aside 4-2. Ultimately, that familiar formula of all offense (2nd in the league) and no defense (29th) wasn't going to cut it anymore, as Terry Stotts exited in favor of Chauncey Billups.

*losses*: The Blazers didn't make major moves (yet) but clearly prioritized that awful defense with their roster tweaks. Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony are both gone; while the two weren't core stars, they played the 3rd and 4th minutes on the team last year.

*gains*: Portland didn't make any major moves, but they did adjust their rotation. Charlotte mainstay Cody Zeller will come in and play the old Kanter/Whiteside role behind Jusuf Nurkic. Wings Tony Snell and Ben McLemore will add some spacing on the perimeter. But more than anything, having C.J. McCollum healthy after missing 30 games last year may be their biggest gain.

*projected record*: GM Neil Olshey has done a decent job adding a little more length on the perimeter to help the defense, but it's hard to see a MAJOR shift in success here. The Blazers are who they are, for better or worse. That should amount to a **46-36** record and a R1/R2 loss. That's better than most teams will do, but the ultimate question is whether it's good enough for Damian Lillard. If I was Olshey, I'd explore a McCollum trade before blowing it all up. McCollum can shine brightly for another team, but he'll never have enough size/defense to be an ideal pairing with Lillard.

---

**(12) DALLAS MAVERICKS**

*last year*: In case there were any doubts about Luka Doncic's status as one of the best players in the NBA, he went out and proved it again with a top 6 MVP finish. Still, there may have been some frustration that the Mavericks didn't rise even *higher*. In terms of record (42-30), point differential (+2.2), and SRS power ranking (9th), the team was almost identical to the previous year. As a result, Rick Carlisle will step away and Jason Kidd will step in.

*losses*: The Mavs called a mulligan on their Seth Curry for Josh Richardson trade, shedding Richardson from the roster. He didn't shoot well (33% from 3) and didn't play as well on defense as expected. Aside from that, almost all of the core remains, including FA Tim Hardaway Jr.

*gains*: In an attempt to replace Seth Curry's shooting, the team brought in Knicks SF Reggie Bullock. He may be the type of 3+D player that they *thought* Josh Richardson would be. Bullock shot 41.0% from 3 (on 6.1 attempts) last year, and he's been 39.2% for his career. With Doncic feeding him passes, he could take another leap from there. Backup big Moses Brown will enter a crowded field down low.

*projected record*: I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock, but it's hard to call that a fundamental shift in the team. As a result, we have to expect them to finish with a similar **47-35** record. In some way, I feel like Mark Cuban knows that. Maybe there's some chance that coach Jason Kidd can improve their defense -- maybe there's some way he can bring out the tiger in Kristaps Porzingis -- maybe he can turn Jalen Brunson into a poor man's Kyle Lowry. But pragmatically, I'd presume that these moves (hiring Kidd, hiring Nike exec Nico Harrison as GM) are more of a ploy to draw in elite free agents in the future. The Mavs may need that next second star to reach their full potential.

**(11) ATLANTA HAWKS**

*last year*: After an offseason spending spree, expectations were high for the rising Hawks. It took a while for proper liftoff. Coach Lloyd Pierce stumbled out of the gates to 14-20, but the move to Nate McMillan clicked immediately. The Hawks finished 41-31, and advanced all the way to the Conference Finals. If there's any reason to throw some cold water on the fire, it's that their playoff streak may have had some good fortune. While they beat Philadelphia 4-3, they were actually outscored by 20 points in the series.

*losses*: Hardly any. Backup PG Kris Dunn is gone, but he barely played due to injuries last year. Similarly, PF Onyeka Okongwu will miss a big chunk of the season, but he also played played due to injuries last year himself. In fact, the biggest story here is the loss that *didn't* happen as PF John Collins returned to the team in free agency.

*gains*: The team acquired PG Delon Wright, who should be an excellent addition for the rotation. Wright has the scoring and slashing chops to help a second unit, but he also has enough size to play alongside Trae Young as well. And if the team wasn't talented enough, they found two good prospects in PF Jalen Johnson (Duke) and PG Sharife Cooper (Auburn) who stumbled into their laps in the draft. Johnson in particular may be able to contribute later on this year; he's a big forward with solid passing ability.

*projected record*: It'd be easy to get carried away with this team and expect them to keep rising and rising and rising. That said, we have to be careful not to jump the gun here. The top of the East is still loaded, and the Hawks may need to prove that they can compete with those elite teams over the long haul. Specifically, we need to see how high McMillan can take this defense (which ranked 21st overall last year.) It's realistic to expect that to climb into the top 15, but it'd be hard for the team to get back to the Conference Finals unless they somehow reach the top 10 there. I don't really see a path forward to do that right now, so I'll go with a good but not great **48-34** record.

---

**(10) MIAMI HEAT**

*last year*: While the Atlanta Hawks hope that their playoff run is a sign of things to come, the Miami Heat are a reminder that the NBA isn't always a clear and easy path up. A year after making the Finals, they disappointed with a 40-32 record and got swept/curb-stomped by Milwaukee in round one. Their offense (ranked 18th overall) may have doomed their chances of rising higher than their 16th rank in total SRS.

*losses*: The backcourt combination of Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn are both gone. Both of them are solid scorers, but struggled with injuries last year (playing 50 and 56 games, respectively.) Oldies Trevor Ariza and Andre Iguodala won't be back either. At their age -- both past 35 -- that's probably the right decision for a team that's looking for more juice on offense. 

*gains*: To add that juice, the Heat will turn to another cagey vet in Kyle Lowry (age 35). At his age, Lowry's durability is the biggest question mark. When he plays, he can still fill up the stat sheet (17.2 points, 7.3 assists) and still space the court (39.6% from 3 last year.) For a team centered on Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, that three-point shooting is critical. The team also added a 36 year old in P.J. Tucker, whom they hope can fill the shoes of the stretch 4 / slugger that Jae Crowder did so well on their Finals run. FA add Markieff Morris may be asked to do the same, although he plays older than his listed age at 31.

*projected record*: Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, P.J. Tucker, Markieff Morris, Bam Adebayo... There's no doubt that this will be one of the toughest teams in the league and one of the best defenses to boot. It's fair to wonder about how much better they are than last year, though. Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn are pretty good players, so it's not like we're starting from scratch at the PG position. I'd also question whether their new additions are fit for the long haul (82 games and a playoff run.) If injuries strike, their depth will be tested. I like the high-end upside and playoff experience here, but the regular season may be a battle. I'm going with a **47-35** record overall (worse than Atlanta) but a slightly better chance to make noise in the playoffs and thus a slightly higher spot on the list. But overall, I think Atlanta and Miami are R2 teams more than conference finalists this time around.",NBA LAYER CAKE: ranking all the teams in the 10-14 range

2017,nba,"I believe they really did. They took a leaf out of Brooklyn's hat on how to defend him since Blake Griffin did a commendable job on Giannis but Giannis just had a slightly below par series vs the Nets (and only in away games).

Monty got everything right tactically vs the nuggets. Defend Jokic one on one with one of the best post defenders in the league, let the role players just play one v one. They kinda did the same thing vs the bucks, and treated Giannis like Jokic.

Not a wise decision because Giannis doesn't thrive in the post but Ayton was no match for Giannis faceup game or quickness off the dribble in half court unlike how he was against the slower methodical Jokic who he had time to defend against. This was how Giannis was defended the entire series and the suns made no changes at all.

The raptors and heat had success in building a wall to stop Giannis. Not every team can build one, the raptors has Siakam, Leonard, And Gasol, while the heat had Butler, Crowder, and Bam. The suns cast of Bridges, Crowder, and Ayton is just as defensively capable for building a wall in my opinion, just as the heat were. 

I would have let Jrue Holiday take open shots, he was just absolutely bricking and help off PJ Tucker and just emulate what the raptors and heat did to stop the bucks. 

The suns went with a man to man approach like they did for Jokic and paid dearly.",[Serious] Did Monty Williams make a huge mistake not following the heat and raptors game plans on guarding Giannis?

&gt;120-119, in Phoenix, Game 5, you lead, Phoenix has the ball. Devin Booker spins and goes into his move with the chance to put the Suns up by 1, and a chance to take a 3-2 lead in the finals. Jrue Holiday strips him. Jrue Holiday is coming down, 3-on-1, shot clock's off. Giannis is streaking down the middle. All of this is happening right in front of you. The lob goes up.   
&gt;  
&gt;**What are you, Mike Budenholzer, thinking in that moment as the lob goes up?**

Budenholzer:

&gt;**Thank god Giannis is on our team**, you know what I mean? When the ball goes up for him, and I know where this is going, the clock, and maybe it's not the smartest or textbook thing, but Jrue and Giannis are just playing on instincts. Maybe they're playing just like we talked about: They're playing free. I was pretty confident that Giannis was going to get it, wasn't sure why Jrue passed it, but when you play with Giannis, your confidence is just through the roof.   
&gt;  
&gt;You know in some ways free-throws are not automatic, and you throw a lob to Giannis, you know he goes and gets it. You know it's 2, and you're still up 3 and you got to get a stop, and have them not score. So I'm grateful for Jrue for making the steal, and Giannis being him. It's just one of those instinctual plays, and I love for our guys to play with that type of confidence. The belief that Jrue has in Giannis to go get it, it's special.

**Bonus exchange:**

Lowe

&gt;All through it all, I think the craziest thing that happening in the entire playoffs, was Giannis going 17 of 19 from the free throw line in the clinching game. When that's happening, is it like a no-hitter, where no one is allowed to talk about, ""oh my god, Giannis is hot at the line!"" Did you joke about it after the game with him like, ""Dude where did that come from?"" Because I remember watching and thinking, ""He's making every freethrow, what's happening?!""

Budenholzer:

&gt;No, certainly did not talk to him about it during the game, and really don't talk to him about freethrows very much during games. After the game, I thought about how hard he works, what a complete game he had, and how many great games he's had during the 3 years I've been with him. But to really make it totally complete, and to be phenomenal from the free throw line, I don't know, it was just for him, for us, to see how much he works, how important he is to us. Just to have that what he did defensively, what he does just everywhere, but for everywhere to include the free throw line? Really really cool, lot of fun for him, lot of fun for us. So yeah, I haven't talked, I'm assuming that's going to be the new bar. He's going to have to do that every night going forward.

Thank god we have Giannis. Also, 17-19 FT is the new norm, count it

2081,nba,"Miles McBride has been making some noise in Summer League for the Knicks, but for his former coaches it's nothing new to hear about him.

&gt;McBride missed most of his junior year at Archbishop Moeller because of a serious foot injury. McBride was the school‚Äôs starting quarterback but got crushed on a hit in early September 2017. As a result, he suffered a Lisfranc injury and missed the rest of the football season and the entire basketball season until he was ready to return for the final two games of the state tournament.

&gt;‚ÄúWe never dreamed it was possible,‚Äù the coach said.

&gt;Kremer rebuffed the team trainer when he was told McBride could play. He was astonished and against it. But Kremer was convinced when the trainer insisted McBride couldn‚Äôt hurt his foot anymore and McBride‚Äôs parents agreed with the decision. Still, he was only allowed to play 12 minutes in each game.

&gt;McBride took the floor with screws in his foot, Kremer said, and then had them removed in the weeks after winning the state title.

Read more about McBride in [Mike Vorkunov's article.](https://theathletic.com/2767961/2021/08/13/knicks-rookie-miles-mcbride-knows-the-way-to-get-on-the-court-in-new-york-and-hes-showing-it/)",Knicks rookie Miles McBride once competed in his high school state championship with screws in his foot that weren't taken out until after winning the state title.

2083,nba,"It took Duncan Robinson just 152 games to put in his first 500 3s, the league record. His last two seasons had 270 and 250 made 3s, respectively.

The all-time leader in 3s is Ray Allen with 2,973 across 1,300 games in 20 seasons.

Assuming Robinson can keep up his current pace of 3s and has a long-enough career, it's feasible he overtakes Ray Allen. In fact, if Robinson's production doesn't dip (which is of course unlikely over a long enough career to set the record), he could blow that number out of the water. If he lasts in the league as long as Allen did, he could put up 4,000.

If he does last another 14 seasons at his current scoring pace, that'd put him at 15,000 career points.

Assuming he never gets any other accolades, and never picks up a ring, would setting the league record for 3s get him into the Hall of Fame? If not just breaking the record, is there any number of made 3s that would get him there?",How many 3s does Duncan Robinson need to make it to the Hall of Fame on 3s alone?

This is largely dependent on if the Clippers are a top 3 seed in the west. PG‚Äôs previous ‚ÄúMVP caliber‚Äù season was when he was on the Thunder playing next to an elite point guard in Westbrook.

I don't watch any basketball league other than the NBA but based on evidence from the Olympics, many national team players seem to be better overall players than certain NBA role players - especially the 3-point shooters, rebounding and defensive specialists. Payton Pritchard plays a ton of minutes for Boston, but I think Nando de Colo is the better overall player. There's also the case of a few young rookies like Wiseman and Doumbouya, who are projects at the moment.

He always drags his team to the finals but can never quite finish the job and loses 4-2 every year. This player cares more about money and stability than anything, so he stays with his drafted team to collect the most money possible.

His stats are always around strong MVP level, hovering around 29/7/7, with some years peaking to something absurd like 37/8/13 and some years dropping to 25/6/6. Always shoots at elite efficiency, has excellent passing, strong defense and no obvious weaknesses. (something akin to Lebron's free throws or Giannis's weak jumpshot or Steph's size). Makes All-NBA first all 17 times, wins a couple of MVPs, and has a good amount of all-defensive selections as well.

He never forms ""superteams"" so he'll never get the label that he only wins with other stars. He only plays on objectively weak teams that would be in the lottery otherwise, but the media and general public at whole may hype his teammates up as a result, and the true skill level of his team may not be acknowledged. He never ""chokes"" in the playoffs and always has a herculean effort to carry his trash team to the finals.

2122,nba,"A small write up on the Green vs Cade matchup broke down how they matched up 1v1, discussing how often Cunningham stopped Jalen and vise versa, as well as how often they scored on one another. 

In regards to ""beaten"" in the article, it is never specified if beaten means scored on our just blown by/beaten 1v1. However Cunningham made 8 shots that game, and checking the highlights 3 of them were not on Green, meaning that beaten in the context of this article means blown by/bested 1v1.

Cade and Green were matched up 1v1 on 17 possessions. 

Of those 17, Cade stopped Green 6 times, and was beaten 4 times. 

When guarding Cunningham, Jalen was beaten on all 7 possessions. 

So if we take a look at some basic math Green was successful 4/10 times while Cade was successful 7/7 times. Obviously this doesnt tell the full story, but I thought it was interesting to look at at the very least.

Stricter ball handling rules prevented actions such as between the legs, behind the back, it would be called carrying 9 times out of 10. Post-ups like what Shaq did would be called offensive fouls every time. Flashy dunks/ finishes were frowned upon, so players had to be disciplined in their style of play. But people still are quick to call them plumbers, etc. without taking the time to understand the circumstances.

2181,nba,"**TL;DR at the bottom -** [**Proof**](https://i.imgur.com/0HeZKPK.jpg)

In 1995, I got to go to my first NBA game -- my dad‚Äôs alma mater (a tiny, now-defunct Baptist Bible college) had arranged an alumni game at the Target Center and the players were able to buy cheap tickets for the Wolves later that evening. The Lakers were in town.

I was obsessed with basketball but we lived over two hours from Minneapolis and I perceived NBA tickets as a luxury beyond our means, so, needless to say, I was pumped *(****semi****-****related****:* [*when you love MJ but can‚Äôt afford a licensed jersey*](https://i.imgur.com/JU6IYX1.png) *- lol here's the* [*full page*](https://i.imgur.com/ZwSKacj.jpg)*)*.

So, my dad‚Äôs game flew by and then we had about 6 hours to kill before the start of Wolves/Lakers. Naturally, my dad figured we‚Äôd hang out in the empty arena for the afternoon.

With about 4 hours til gametime, we were in the lower bowl and 9 year-old me was getting restless. There was a basketball clinic happening on the court and maybe about 30 people scattered around the seats on one side.

On the other side, a few rows up, there was a single person, half-watching the clinic.

**My dad**: ‚ÄúSee that guy sitting over there, you know who that is?‚Äù

**Me**: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, who?‚Äù

‚ÄúMichael Cooper - he used to play for the Lakers with Magic Johnson when they were called Showtime. I think he‚Äôs an assistant coach now.""

*(9 years old me not at all grasping the legacy of Michael Cooper)* ‚ÄúOh, that's cool‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should go over and ask for his autograph‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, I don‚Äôt want to‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?? How many times do you get a chance like this??‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, fine‚Äù

Now, I had come prepared with every Laker and/or Timberwolf basketball card that I owned but, much to my chagrin, Michael Cooper was not in my collection. So, we decided that the next best option was asking him to sign my ticket stub ([pic of stub)](https://i.imgur.com/pNIUTwf.png).

I slunk over to the other side of the court, around the clinic, and avoided eye contact until the last possible moment.

**Me**: ‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr. Cooper, I was wondering if you would sign my ticket stub?‚Äù

**Michael**: ‚ÄúOf course! What are you doing here so early?""

‚ÄúMy dad was playing in a basketball game earlier and now we‚Äôre waiting for the Timberwolves game to start.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, ok ok, you a Timberwolves fan?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm a Bulls fan.‚Äù

*(laughs)* ‚ÄúWell, how come you aren‚Äôt in the clinic?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt know about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou play basketball?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes""

‚ÄúWould you like to be in it? Go get your dad and I‚Äôll meet you down on the court.‚Äù

Michael walked over and introduced himself to my dad and said something to the clinic leader. The next thing I knew I was on the court in my jeans and polo shirt doing defensive slides. I couldn't believe what was happening.

We moved to a shooting drill next. I was about to take a shot on an NBA rim. My first attempt hit front rim but dropped through with a lucky roll. Michael says, to my dad, ‚ÄúOh, the kid can score!‚Äù

After a few more drills/games it started to wrap up and we circled for a closing pep talk¬†(plus Timberwolves trivia).

At this point there was so much adrenaline coursing through my 9-year-old body that I was practically blacked out but I do remember two of the trivia questions:

* Who scored the first basket in Timberwolves history? *(Sam Mitchell; one of the older kids knew)*
* What high schooler did the Timberwolves select in the most recent draft? *(this one I knew! I had my hand up as soon as I heard high school and gleefully blurted out KG).*

I didn't want it to end but, of course, it did. My dad and Michael were waiting on the sideline and we both began thanking him profusely, thinking we were about to part ways.

**Michael**: ‚ÄúWhere you guys sitting?‚Äù

**My** **dad** *(sheepishly)*: ‚ÄúAh, you know, we‚Äôre up in the nosebleeds‚Äù

*(looking at our stubs, smiling)*: ""Nah, I‚Äôll get something else for you, wait here‚Äù

He comes back with a pair of tickets about 15 rows up, which was as good as courtside as far as we were concerned.

**Michael**: ""Alright, I gotta go get a few things ready but you guys want to come into the locker room before the game? Meet me over there an hour before tip (gestures towards tunnel)‚Äù

He said it with such nonchalance that I didn‚Äôt understand what had just happened -- of course my dad said yes and, as promised, Michael was waiting by the tunnel an hour before tip.

**Michael**: ""Let‚Äôs go see the Minny guys first, we‚Äôll have to grab them on the court""

He literally walked me around to every single Timberwolves player that was out there (including KG, Laettner, and Tom Gugliotta), gets them to stop shooting, shake my hand, and sign a program as well as one of my cards (if I had one for that player). You can see me standing next to [Laettner](https://i.imgur.com/oSAcJKl.png) and then [Gugliotta](https://i.imgur.com/9CUIH3y.png) in the scrapbook pics. Every single player acted like they couldn't have been happier to interact with me. Michael had the juice.

Then we headed into the locker room and did the same with everybody on the Lakers (Van Exel, Eddie Jones, Vlade, etc). I was so awestruck that I could hardly speak to introduce myself every time we met someone else.

We left the locker room a few minutes before the players went out for tip, and headed toward our seats. Michael was, inexplicably, apologetic that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to meet up with us after the game (lol as if he hadn‚Äôt done enough already) but he asked for our number and said he‚Äôd give us a call next time the Lakers were in town.

The Lakers ended up winning by two in a nailbiter, which managed to feel anticlimactic after all of the pre-game excitement. We re-lived every second on the 2+ hour drive home, laughing in disbelief about  how lucky we had been.

As for Michael, we figured he meant what he said about the next game -- but we also assumed there was no way he‚Äôd remember so we kept our expectations low -- he‚Äôd already been more generous than we could have ever asked for, after all.

A few months later, there‚Äôs a message on our voicemail, from Michael. Lakers are in town in a few weeks and he wants to leave tickets for us at the will call. Oh, and get there early, he says‚Ä¶Magic is back.

I‚Äôll save that part for another time.

So far the consensus names in top 11 without order are:

5. They play both sides of the court. Offense and Defense. 

6. They are also a capable team player if needed.

7. Can Play and Be Effective Off Ball, or without the ball in their hands.

8. Have Some Or Many Clutch Moments

If Giannis wins 1 or 2 more rings with Finals MVP, and another MVP and DPOY. I will really consider him at least Top 10. Of course he should have enough longevity and consistent all star appearance.

Another mistake was trading for Westbrook. He's a great player, bit he only exemplifies the weaknesses kf the Lakers. Aging, egos, turnovers, and lack of overall three point shooting. This is why the Lakers are weakend. On the east, the Nets or Hawks are probably gonna take it, and when it comes down to it, I think we will play better against them than they will against us.

&amp;#x200B;

the ranking system is not perfect but this is it

playoff result within 5 or OT - 10 points

playoff result within 5-10 - 5 points

playoff result within 10-20 - 3 points

blowout - 0 points

game 7 result within 5 or OT  - 12 points

game 7 result within 10  -  7 points

for ties - more exciting game 7 takes precedent

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

10. Nuggets Vs Trail Blazers 2019 playoffs

score - 45 points

notes - The series with the famous quadruple overtime in game 3 with Rodney hood hitting the game winner. There was only 1 blowout and game 7 was close with a CJ dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Clippers vs Spurs 2015 playoffs

score - 45 points

notes - An overall amazing series with 2 title contenders going at it including the reigning champions. game 7 was even better than the Nuggets/Blazers with a cp3 game winner.

&amp;#x200B;

8.  Clippers vs Warriors 2014 playoffs

score - 47 points

notes - Last series of the Mark Jackson and pre MVP steph curry era was pretty wild. This series featured bitter rivals LA and Golden state in a hard fought series that could have gone either way but the Clippers won an extremely close game 7.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Raptors vs Celtics 2020 playoffs

score - 50

notes - this series was the most competitive in the bubble and features incredibly close games for the most part with the OG buzzer beating 3 point game winner the highlight.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Clippers vs Jazz 2017 playoffs

score - 53 points

notes - This was Chris Paul's last series as  a LA Clipper and 6/7 games were within 10 points and the highlight was Joe Johnson's game 1 game winner. Slightly lesser grade since game 7 was not the most exciting.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Clippers vs Grizzlies 2012 playoffs

score - 53 points

notes - Lob city do love close playoff series don't they? This is another close one in Chris Paul's first series as a clipper and they went against the famous grit n grind grizzlies. 6/7 games were separated by 10 points with 4 games separated by 5 points. game 7 was a 10 point game though.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Lakers vs Nuggets 2012 playoffs

score - 53 points

notes - Im not going to lie guys, I literally did not know this series even took place but it did. Ty Lawson and Gallo took the Kobe/Pau Lakers to 7 and almost every game was close as well. Slightly better game 7 than the previous series.

&amp;#x200B;

3. 76ers vs Hawks 2021 playoffs

score - 53 points

notes - Yeah I mean this series was just crazy. Other than 2 moderate blowouts every single game had something interesting and crazy going on. Embiid beasting and turning to shit alternatively, Trae Young doing the same thing as Embiid, Ben Simmons becoming a meme, Seth Curry playing like his brother, Hawks bench proving to be the difference, oh and the 26 point lead etc, this series was one of the best playoff series ever.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  Cavaliers vs Pacers 2018 playoffs

score - 55 points

notes - People forget that the Oladipo Pacers were the team who gave Lebron the most trouble in the eastern conference in the 2018 playoffs. LeBron had to be Superhuman to win this series including a crazy game winner in game 4. No surprise that this series is so high.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Raptors vs Nets 2014 playoffs

score - 55 points

notes - One of the most underrated series ever consisting of the ""superteam"" Brooklyn nets and the first playoff series of the Lowry/DeRozan Raptors. This series was just mad. No blowouts. 6/7 games within 10. Absolutely mad game 7 at Toronto which was a painful one point loss for the home team. You guys need to watch game 7 highlights, Joe Johnson and Lowry went crazy. Game 7 separates this and the Cavs/Pacers series.

2413,nba,,[Clippers] Continuing our journey together. We have officially re-signed @kawhileonard.
2414,nba," **2021 offseason:**

We start off with unbelievable news. **Stephen  Curry, Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman and a first round pick are traded  to the Brooklyn Nets for James Harden and Kyrie Irving!!** I'm  not sure how or why this happened, but this is easily the craziest thing  I've seen in simulation. Imagine if this happened in real life.

In  the rest of the offseason, Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroder both  re-sign with the Lakers(although Schroder for only 1.64 million a year.)  DeMar DeRozan re-signs with the Spurs, Carmelo still goes to the Lakers, Kyle Lowry signs with the Hornets(??), and Lonzo Ball signs with  the Knicks on a 4 year deal worth 18.3 million a year. Everyone else mainly stays with the same teams, except that for some reason the Westbrook trade is already completed in the game.

 **2021-2022 season:**

At the deadline, Kyle Lowry is traded to the Mavericks. Nothing else of note really happens.

The standings at the end of the season are:

**Eastern Conference:**

1. **Boston Celtics: 59-23**
2. **Atlanta Hawks: 55-27**
3. **Miami Heat: 55-27**
4. **Brooklyn Nets: 55-27**
5. **Milwakuee Bucks: 49-33**
6. **Philadelphia 76ers: 47-35**
7. **Chicago Bulls: 43-39**
8. **Orlando Magic: 43-39** 

The Raptors struggle and finish last, at 27-55. The Magic, led by rookie  Jalen Suggs, get a shock playoff spot. Curry and Durant both have  amazing seasons, averaging 28 points apiece. The Celtics, led by Jayson  Tatum(31/9/7), get the top seed. Giannis averages 32/12/5, but Middleton  and Jrue take steps back, hurting their record(for some reason Middleton scored only 17 points on 54% TS, while Jrue's defense isn't really well accounted for in the programming)

 

**Western Conference:**

1. **Dallas Mavericks: 54-28**
2. **Golden State Warriors: 52-30**
3. **Los Angeles Lakers: 50-32**
4. **Los Angeles Clippers: 49-33**
5. **Portland Trail Blazers: 43-39**
6. **San Antonio Spurs: 42-40**
7. **Memphis Grizzlies: 42-40**
8. **Phoenix Suns: 41-41**

 Luka Doncic averages an insane 37/12/9 on 62% TS, taking home MVP honors  and leading the Mavericks to the #1 seed. James Harden averages 28  points and 10 assists and Kyrie averages 26 points, helping the Warriors  improve drastically over the previous season. The Lakers disappoint as  Westbrook declines dramatically, averaging only 15/6/10 on 48% TS. Kawhi  Leonard comes back in the last 30 games of the season, averaging 32.3  points as the Clippers finish 25-5 and roar back into a playoff spot.  The Suns massively underperform, as their defense simply collapses,  despite Booker averaging 29 a game. The Jazz, due to a massive collapse in their defense(27th in the league), miss the playoffs entirely, finishing 38-44.

 

**Round 1:**

**Mavericks beat Suns in 5**

**Grizzlies beat Warriors in 6**

**Lakers beat Spurs in 6**

**Clippers beat Blazers in 7**

**Celtics beat Magic in 7**

**Nets beat Bucks in 5**

**76ers beat Heat in 5**

**Hawks beat Bulls in 7**

 The biggest surprise is by far the  Warriors losing in the first round. James Harden chokes horribly in this  series, averaging 18.2 points in the series on 37/25/78 shooting,  including 3/17 with 11 points in the closeout game 6(a game the Warriors  lost only 91-85.) The Clippers beat the Blazers in 7, with Dame going a  horrendous **5-26** in  game 7. Lillard, who averaged 31.2 PPG in the regular season, only  averaged 24 PPG on 51% TS in the playoffs and is getting intense  criticism currently. Nets-Bucks seemed like a marquee matchup, but it  turns out to be very lopsided, with Kevin Durant averaging 38.6 PPG  during the series. The Magic, led by Jalen Suggs, take the 1 seed  Celtics to 7, but lose in a fairly tight game(107-98.)

**Round 2:**

**Clippers beat Mavericks in 6**

**Lakers beat Grizzlies in 4**

**Nets beat Celtics in 7**

**Hawks beat 76ers in 5**

The  top seeded Celtics choke badly, blowing a 3-1 lead with games 5 and 7  at home. Stephen Curry scores a historic 58 points in game 7 on 18/30  shooting(14/24 from three!) to close it out. The Lakers brush aside the  overmatched Grizzlies. The Clippers beat the Mavericks for the third  time in a row, as Kyle Lowry scores 0 points on 0-13 shooting in game 6,  cancelling out 44 from Luka and 31 from Porzingis. Trae Young, the  league's second leading scorer with 32.9 PPG, and the Hawks beat the  Sixers much easily this time, as Joel Embiid exits with an injury midway  through game 3 with the series tied 1-1.

**Conference Finals:**

**Nets over Hawks in 7**

**Lakers over Clippers in 5**

The  Lakers win very easily, as Kawhi Leonard has one of his worst series,  going 4-18, 7-22, and 6-21 in the last three games(all losses.) The Nets  go to 7 with the Hawks, but Curry and Durant combine for 76 points in  game 7, edging out the Hawks 110-104.

**FINALS(LAKERS VS NETS):**

**Game 1:**

**Nets 131, Lakers 125(OT).**  Kevin Durant hits a buzzer beater midrange to tie the game with 0.2  seconds left. In overtime, Steph Curry takes over, scoring 12 points in 5  minutes, as the Nets take the lead. Anthony Davis picks up a minor  injury, but he will play through it. LeBron James scores 37 in the loss,  while Steph has 42 and KD 36.

 **Game 2:**

**Lakers 109, Nets 105.**  This time, Durant, who did score 35 points, misses a go-ahead three  with the score at 107-105. Steph Curry struggles in this game, going  8-23 with only 21 points. LeBron has 26/5/7, AD 29/9/4, and the Lakers  escape this one.

**Game 3:**

**Lakers 87, Nets 78.**  Durant gets hurt in the first minute and has to leave the game. With  Griffin shooting 3-10 and Wiggins 1-9, the whole Lakers defense is able  to focus on Curry. He does score 32 points, but on 11-32 shooting(6-20  from three). AD drops 30 in this game, LeBron 21 and 18, and the Lakers  shut down the Nets to take a 2-1 series lead.

**Game 4:**

**Lakers 114, Nets 103.**  Durant is still out with his injury. Again, Curry takes 32 shots, this  time going 13/32 with 39 points(9-21 from three), but gets very little  help. The Lakers offense is much more balanced, with LeBron having 23,  AD 19, Westbrook 16, Drummond 14, and Schroder 12. Just as in real life  this year, Joe Harris has been a nonfactor, scoring 8 PPG on 47% TS. The  Lakers are now 1 win away from a championship.

**Game 5:**

**Nets 137, Lakers 113.**  Durant drops 54 points in his return(16-33 from the field, 7-18 from  three, 15/16 FT), Curry scores 30 on only 17 shots, and Wiggins adds 19  to propel the Nets to an easy win.

**Game 6:**

**Nets 108, Lakers 100.**  LeBron James has one of his all time worst playoff performances,  scoring 21 points on 7-27 shooting. AD is similarly poor on smaller  volume(4-13, 14 points). Curry scores 32(including 7 threes) on 20  shots, Durant adds 28, and the Nets force a game 7.

**Game 7:**

**Nets 114, Lakers 110.**  One of the craziest Finals games of all time, and likely to be a source  on controversy among Lakers fans for years to come. Kevin Durant's 55  points include 24 FT attempts(on which he was 23/24). LeBron James plays  weirdly passive throughout the whole game, going only 5/14. In  addition, for some reason, Anthony Davis took the most important shot  from 3, missing while trailing 102-100 with 5 seconds left(he shot 4/12  from three in this game!) Curry struggles for much of the game, going  9/25(6/16 from three) with 29 points, but hits the game winning shot  with 30 seconds left and the score tied at 100.

And so..... after coming back from a 3-1 deficit......

**THE BROOKLYN NETS ARE YOUR 2021-2022 NBA CHAMPIONS!**

Despite  missing two games, Kevin Durant is your Finals MVP, averaging an  obscene 39.6 PPG over the 5 games that he played. He gets his 3rd ring  and Curry his 4th, with Warrior fans wondering what could have been.

Note: Im not adding teams that are already contending so teams that won a playoff series wont be on here. My descriptions are brief mentioning players who I think are Borderline/Franchise players. Open to a more in depth discussion of teams in the thread.

Rockets- Missed out on the top pick but they got Green and multiple draft picks

OKC- SGA and almost infinite Draft Picks

Minnesota- KAT can still get better, whether thats on the Twolves or not remains to be seen. They can always trade him for picks and rebuild like the Rockets and Thunder with Williams as the centerpiece 

Golden State: With the last 2 Drafts the Warriors can either keep their young prospects potentially developing them on a winning team or trade for a 3rd star 

Pelicans: Had a forgettable draft day but the Valanciunas deal is the most under rated of the offseason, creating more long term cap flexibility by trading away Bledsoe and Adams changes their whole rebuild. Maybe they learned their mistakes from the AD era?

Grizzlies: Morant and Jaren Jackson Jnr have arguably been better and overachieved early in their rebuild

Mavs: They have Luka although the Porzingis contract hinders their rebuild if he doesnt get better or regresses

Spurs: Dont have a standout player to build around (Murray could be) but the Spurs seem to finally have embraced the rebuild and I have faith in their organisation

Cavs: Didnt mess up the draft like in past seasons and made the right choice with Mobley to pair with Sexton

Knicks: Didnt do what they always do and handicap themselves by overpaying above average players. Or rush into making a move. Playoffs did expose that move will have to come down the line

Celtics: Tatum and Brown. Need to add another piece unless they can trade one of them for a top 10 player. Schroeders contract compared to Kembas is a huge advantage going forward

Raptors:  The rebuild has begun and it remains to be seen if Barnes over Suggs was the right deal but they have a great GM and have become one of the most well run clubs in recent years.

Hornets: Similar to the Grizzlies in the East at an earlier stage. Lacking a clear cut second piece to build around after Lamelo though.

Magic: No clear superstar or even all star prospect to build around (Issaac/Carter Jnr could be and Fultz is still a long term project but at least they have finally embraced their rebuild after years of middling out.

Wizards: Beal is a borderline superstar. Can run it back and build around him after the Westbrook team or blow it up before he becomes a FA.

Pistons: Won the lottery and have good complimentary pieces in Grant, Bey and Hayes.","Which ""Up and Coming"" teams have brightest future?"

3. (Positively) Minnesota Timberwolves (Assuming they stay healthy)

2. (Negatively) Philadelphia 76ers

2502,nba,"Carlos Boozer left the Cavs for the Jazz after LeBron's rookie year. But what if Boozer stayed in Cleveland?

Here's what I think would have happened:

**2004-05:** There were only 5 games separating the #9 seeded Cavs and the #4 seeded Bulls (division winners were the top 3 seeds back then), so Boozer (who averaged 18/9 that year) would have almost certainly been able to flip at least 6 of the Cavs' losses into wins, so the Cavs are the #4 seed. They beat the #5 seeded Bulls in the first round and lose to the Heat in the 2nd round.

**2005-06:** The Cavs still finish as the #4 seed, but with Boozer they beat the Pistons in the 2nd round instead of losing to them in 7, then they beat the Heat in the ECF and the Mavs in the Finals, so LeBron (and Boozer) give Cleveland it's first championship since the 1964 Browns 10 years earlier.

**2006-07:** In reality, the Cavs got swept by the Spurs, however the last 2 games were very close. With Boozer (who averaged 21/12 that year), they close out those games and carry to momentum to the next two games to win the Finals in 6.

**2007-08:** In reality, the Cavs lost to the Celtics in 7, so Boozer is enough to give them the series win. They then beat the Pistons and the Bynum-less Lakers (Bynum was hurt) just as the Celtics did. 

**2008-09:** Boozer gets hurt just like he did in reality, but LeBron develops his killer instinct in Game 6 of the 2009 ECF against the Magic instead of Game 6 of the 2012 ECF so the Cavs lose to the Lakers in the Finals.

**2009-10:** With Boozer recovered from his injury from the previous season, the Cavs lose to the Lakers in the Finals instead of the Celtics in the ECSF.

**2010 offseason:** Since LeBron has help, he doesn't have to leave for Miami so he stays in Cleveland, and Chris Bosh joins him so he can be part of a dynasty.

**2010-11:** The Cavs beat to the Mavericks in the Finals, as LeBron has already developed his killer instinct. Also, the Cavs still trade Mo Williams to the Clippers for an unprotected 2011 1st during the regular season.

**2011 offseason:** That Clippers pick the Cavs got for Mo Williams still wins the draft lottery, so the Cavs use that 1st overall pick on a guard out of Duke named Kyrie Irving.

**2011-12:** Boozer is starting to show signs of age, but LeBron and Bosh still win the Finals with the help of their ROY guard Kyrie. Also, during 

**2012-13:** Ray Allen still joins LeBron and Bosh, but they don't need a clutch shot from him as young Kyrie makes more of a difference than aging Wade in the Finals.

**2013-14:** The Cavs actually manage to beat the Spurs in the Finals, as in reality, Wade was cooked in the actual 2014 Finals so the Spurs' focused all their energy on LeBron, but they can't do that since the Cavs have Kyrie.


**2014 offseason:** The Cavs trade Chris Bosh to the Wizards for Tristan Thompson, who the Wizards drafted in in 2011 since the Cavs' own pick was a late first instead of the 4th pick.

**2014-15:** The Cavs still make the Finals and Kyrie still gets hurt so the Cavs still lose in 6.

**2015 offseason:** The Cavs trade some picks and bums to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love since he has one year left on his contract. This is where we merge back with the actual timeline, with some unimportant details changed. The Cavs still comeback from a 3-1 lead, KD still joins the Warriors, Kyrie is still traded to the Celtics, LeBron still leaves for LA in 2018, and AD is still traded to LA in 2019.",What if Carlos Boozer stayed with the Cavs instead of leaving after LeBron's rookie season?

When Westbrook drives it‚Äôs probably difficult to dish the ball all the way back to them. Now.. He‚Äôll have an elite player right there with him in the paint. So when he drives, whoever‚Äôs guarding AD will have to leave him to stop Westbrook, and Russell can dish it to AD for an easy basket. AD is also a good shooter so AD can just sit in the corner. When Westbrook drives, the C or PF will probably be guarding AD at the perimeter which will leave the paint WIDE OPEN for Russell, and if the Center does come in, again Westbrook can pass it to AD for an open 3 pointer. I think that will become extremely difficult to defend. Plus those two could become extremely lethal with the pick and roll. Russell‚Äôs probably gonna throw sooo many alley oops to AD this year.

2521,nba,,"[NBA Referees] In full transparency, this was an out of bounds violation that was missed."
2522,nba,"Dennis Rodman grew up not knowing what love was.

His aptly named father, Philander, left his wife, Shirley, and a young Dennis for the Philippines. He would have at least 25 (Dennis has said it was as many as 47) more children with at least 16 different women. From there, men in Shirley's life only got worse; Dennis has recounted that in a particularly horrifying incident, one tried to kill her by running her over with a lawnmower.

None of these men were going to act as Dennis' father, and his strained relationship with his mother ensured that he would have to raise himself. Dennis had grown up a self-proclaimed ""mama's boy"" before his teen years, clutching onto his mother and refusing to leave her side. Shirley, however, didn't demonstrate the same physical expressions of love- she never hugged her children or said she loved them. In Dennis' words, ""She never came close...she couldn't show love because all she knew was abuse.""

Growing up Black in the 1960s and 70s, in Dallas' projects in abject poverty, nothing came easily for Dennis Rodman. For a long time, nothing came at all. Dennis grew up with everything going against him, basketball and football his only ways out. While both of Dennis' sisters found their way to college via basketball scholarships, Dennis was actually the odd man out of the family on the court. He failed to make his high school's football team, and when he finally made the basketball team, he rarely left the bench. Rodman said that his athletic failures in his youth made his mother more interested in his sisters than him, further excluding him in an entirely female household.

At 18 and 5'9 with no future prospects, Shirley kicked Dennis out of the house, leaving him homeless.

Rodman does the impossible:

Rodman found work as an overnight airport janitor, but spent most of the following year homeless. Then, something incredible happened. In the year between Rodman's 19th and 20th birthday, he grew from 5'11 to his eventual height of 6'7. For context, the average male is essentially done growing by the age of 16, and Rodman grew more in that year than he did between his freshman year of high school and the age of 19. A family friend would tip off a local community college basketball coach about the 6'7, now 22-year-old Rodman. For the first time, Dennis had hope.

Basketball became Rodman's escape from an unforgiving place without a way out. While his skills were raw and he was still adjusting to his body, he played with unmatched energy and desire. Pointing to the crowd with a giant smile on his face every time he made a good play and running around like a maniac, Rodman's basketball joy was contagious. In Dennis' words years later, ""I was so happy just to be there...I'm not trying to show off, I'm just so happy, so excited. My life was changing.""

Although Rodman flunked out of Cooke County College after one season, he had done enough to get himself another look, averaging 17 points and 13 rebounds. He transferred to Southeastern Oklahoma State University, which (as a NAIA school) played close to the equivalent of D-II opponents.After a very successful first season, Rodman met a 12-year-old camper named Bryne Rich at a youth basketball camp. Rich, a 5'3 white kid growing up in rural Oklahoma, and Rodman, a fully grown 6'7 Black man, were considered an unlikely pair. However, mutual hardship ensured that the two needed each other; they quickly became inseparable, as Rodman would spend the next three years in Rich's home. Below is a segment from halftime of the 1990 NBA Finals that details the situation (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=01Y62vpjCWg%5C%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D01Y62vpjCWg%29%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D01Y62vpjCWg%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D01Y62vpjCWg%29%29)

It also provides an intriguing look (at 4:00) at Rodman as a loving and caring father with his first child, Alexis. Tearing up, Rodman described her by saying, *""She's strong, and she smiles all the time. She's a very happy baby...you're not a man- you're not a person if you don't cry. It makes me feel good talking about everything that's worthwhile.""*

Rodman's happiness and ease that came from playing with his child was palpable; that wouldn't always be there.While it is challenging to gain recognition as an NBA prospect outside of Division I, especially considering Rodman‚Äôs older age, what he did over his three seasons ensured that he would garner attention from teams at the highest level. He led the NAIA in rebounding twice, averaging 26-16 over his three seasons. In his final season, he led SOSU to the #3 overall ranking in the NAIA and the NAIA Final Four. In the NAIA tournament, Rodman had separate games in which he managed 46 points and a tournament record of 32 rebounds.


While many teams still didn't have Rodman on their radar given his lack of competition and his advanced age (25 by the 1986 NBA draft), there was an emerging contender in Detroit that found his rebounding, defense, desire, and tenacity to be precisely what they needed to get to the next level. However, nobody could have anticipated the greatness that Rodman would go on to offer, nor the downward spiral that led Dennis to his truck at 5 AM with a rifle in his lap, contemplating what to do next.",[OC]: Dennis Rodman: The Baddest Man in Sports Wasn‚Äôt What He seemed

As much fun as it is to start these Summer League narratives, the stuff we see here is pretty much irrelevant to actual NBA ball.","Randy Foye, Adam Morrison, Kyle Kuzma, Aaron Brooks, and CJ McCollum have the highest scoring averages of any rookies to play at least five games in the Vegas Summer League."
2541,nba,"Jayson Tatum is knocking on the door of superstardom. He may be ""top fiye"" in our hearts, but realistically, he's sitting somewhere around the 15th best player in the league. That's an absolute home run of a draft pick, but short of the 04 Pistons, I can't think of a team that won where their best player wasn't a clear cut top 10 player. I will humbly submit that Jayson Tatum does not need to get any better at scoring the basketball to make that jump into the top 10, but instead must develop as a passer and playmaker to truly unlock his superstar potential. 



Bill Simmons (I know, bear with me here people!) opens up his Book of Basketball with a conversation with Isiah Thomas (the asshole not our beloved King in the Fourth). Their discussion centers around ""The Secret"" of basketball. Isiah ultimately concludes that ""the Secret of basketball is that it's not about basketball."" Simmons elaborates: 



*Nobody writes about The Secret because of a general lack of sophistication about basketball; even the latest ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô of basketball statistics centers more around evaluating players against one another over capturing their effect on a team. Numbers help, but only to a certain degree. You still have to watch the games. The fans don‚Äôt get it. Actually, it goes deeper than that‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure who gets it. We measure players by numbers, only the playoffs roll around and teams that play together, kill themselves defensively, sacrifice personal success and ignore statistics invariably win the title.*



The ""sacrifice personal success"" makes me think of Giannis relentlessly attacking the rim and going to the line despite embarrassing himself there on occasion. It didn't matter, he knew his team needed him to be aggressive to be successful, ego be damned (looking at you Ben Simmons). 



In order for the Celtics and Tatum to take the next step, he needs to buy into this concept. Post deadline, Tatum took another leap that many folks outside of Boston have seemingly ignored.  Tatum's ugly COVID riddled February clouded the judgment of a lot of talking heads. Post trade deadline, his stats are fucking nuts for a high volume guy playing with almost no help and a rotating cast of misfits  - 29-8.2-4.2 with a 47.9/39.7/87.8 slash line, good for a 60.8 TS%.  That puts him elite company as a scorer. How much better can he realistically expect to get at scoring the ball? At some point, a player has reached a level of volume and efficiency that should be plenty good enough to be a superstar, but the other facets of their game must come along as well. 



And guess what, the Celtics went 15-11 in games Tatum played after the deadline and his Net Rating was a solid but unspectacular 2.8.  Tatum drives winning with his scoring, but he does not drive winning at the level of the elite stars in the league. The reason he doesn't is because he has yet to unlock The Secret. He doesn't make his teammates substantially better, yet. 



Here's the frustrating thing with Tatum, he is completely capable of being a borderline elite playmaker.  He's got almost every pass in his bag. He can hit [pocket passes](https://youtu.be/6Ye3r3fg9zU?t=2), [behind the back no looks to shooters](https://youtu.be/6Ye3r3fg9zU?t=15), [sweet little drop offs](https://youtu.be/6Ye3r3fg9zU?t=66), [one handed bullet passes](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=1&amp;CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;PlayerID=1628369&amp;TeamID=1610612738&amp;GameID=0022000685&amp;ContextMeasure=AST&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;LeagueID=00&amp;DateFrom=&amp;DateTo=&amp;Sorter=DATE&amp;Direction=DESC&amp;PlayerOrTeam=P&amp;Counter=1000&amp;section=players&amp;sct=plot) . . . I think you get the picture. Hell those first three are from the same game!  Again, while it's frustrating that he CAN make these passes and does not always, that should be exciting for Cs fans as well. Becoming a more willing passer is much easier than figuring out how to read a defense and being physically capable of exploiting it. I will show you what I mean, but first, as always, the stats. 



**Where Tatum Ranks Among High Usage Wings (Spoiler: It's not Great)**



The chart below is going to show you where Tatum ranks among qualifying non-guards (NBA.com is funky, I put in ""Forward"" as a filter but Embiid shows up and so does Shake Milton. What does that mean, I have no fucking clue, but I'm just going to say ""non-guard"") in certain important metrics. I've isolated only high usage players. I wanted to see where he ranks among his peers. So for Ast%, I only took players with a USG% over 25, and Drives were players who drive more than 10 times a game, etc. 





Metric | Number | Rank
:--:|:--:|:--:
Ast% | 19.6 | 14 of 25
Potential Ast | 8.5 | 18 of 29
Ast to Pass% | 8.7 | 21 of 29
Pass% on Drives | 29.7 | 17 of 20
Ast% on Drives | 7.3 | 17 of 20
Pass% on Post Ups | 26.2 | 35 of 40
Ast % on Post Ups | 4.3 | 31 of 40





Unfortunately NBA.com doesn't track passing data on PnR Ballhandler Possessions and Isos, but I would venture to guess he ranks much better as a PnR Ballhandler and similarly poor on Isos. His ast% is putrid on drives and post ups, but ok overall, I think it's being propped up by his pick and roll playmaking somewhat. 



With that said, his passing stats are fine, but not indicative of an offensive hub. Tatum's playmaking is much closer to Pascal Siakam than it is to Jimmy Butler right now, and that's not a good thing.  I'm willing to forgive his Ast to Pass% a bit because he had a TON of passes to non-shooters and offensive zeros last year like Grant Williams and Semi O. What I'm not willing to forgive is how often he passes out of drives and post ups, or rather how rarely he does so. Those are two playtypes where you are putting pressure on the rim, the defense has to help.  Tatum isn't even really *looking* to pass most of the time on these, and that's the real problem. Let me show you what I mean. 



**Leveraging His Leverage**



As I said above, Tatum has morphed into an elite high volume scorer. That naturally means he's getting a ton of defensive attention.  At times, I don't think he truly realizes how dialed in defenses are to him. I mean [the Nets basically triple covered him all series](https://imgur.com/9uFGzfK), Tatum's side of the floor is TOTALLY EMPTY! The craziest part about this is that Tatum turned that possession into a mid range jumper, he made it but that's not the point. He's being triple covered, SOMEONE is open. Let's break down some more examples. 




*Passing on Drives*



Tatum isn't known for his attacking play, but he actually led the Celtics in drives per game last year, and compares favorably to all but the most aggressive attackers. He was borderline elite at finishing at the rim last season so it's no surprise he draws a ton of attention when he gets into the paint.  It's this attention that makes his low Pass% on drives (percent of drives that end in a pass) so damning.  For reference, Demar DeRozan, a guy who has aged into a borderline elite playmaker, passes on 45% of his drives to Tatum's 29.7%.  



Let's look at some examples. [This first play](https://youtu.be/x1PkA0yM9Tc) shows the best and worse of Tatum's game. He absolutely shakes Aaron Gordon and gets into the lane with ease. Rob Williams, an elite rim finishes with Charmin soft hands, is wide open for an easy drop off. Tatum takes a bullshit floater. [This one is similarly bad]( https://youtu.be/x1PkA0yM9Tc?t=18) although the shot clock is running low so I get why he put the shot up, but look at how open Jaylen is. He's got 3 seconds on the clock when he goes into the shot, that's more than enough time to hit Jaylen and have him get a normal jumper off. Tatum doesn't bother, up goes another bullshit floater.  [Or this play](https://youtu.be/kXAJNdZZDow?t=44) where he meanders into the lane and fires up a no chance mid range jumper. I mean [look at poor Payton Pritchard in the near corner](https://imgur.com/7YtE6Hc) begging for a pass. The result? bullshit mid range jumper.  




This is the part of the program where I tell you that Tatum shot 66% (good!) from 0-4 feet and a putrid 36.7% from 5-14 feet. Teams are begging for Tatum to take bad floaters in the lane, especially at the expense of getting all the way to the basket or hitting shooters for spot ups. 



*Passing from the Post*



Tatum didn't post up a ton last year, 2.6 per game, but it's something I'd like to see more of. What I really would like to see more of is him passing out of the post. It's incredible how much attention he gets with a simple post up. He should be able to rack up assists and easy offense for the Celtics. Alas, he passes a measly 26% of the time. [I mean, look at how wide open](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&amp;CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;PlayerID=1628369&amp;TeamID=1610612738&amp;GameID=0022000699&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;LeagueID=00&amp;DateFrom=&amp;DateTo=&amp;Sorter=FGA&amp;Direction=DESC&amp;PlayerOrTeam=P&amp;Counter=1000&amp;section=players&amp;sct=plot&amp;CF=p*E*2:ACTION_TYPE*E*Turnaround%20Fadeaway%20shot) Jaylen Brown is here once Tatum gets into his move. Tatum needs to leverage that attention for easy shots, not put up yet another bullshit mid range jumper.  [In this one](https://youtu.be/5hYZ5ZR-RUI?t=162), Tatum backs his way into the high post, but almost immediately PP's guy helps and leave PP, an elite 3pt shooter, completely unguarded. [There's like 1,000 feet of space,](https://imgur.com/nsrBuzh) and that's a very easy pass with his back to the basket like that. PP should have relocated closer to the break, but Tatum never even looks his way. He's thinking bullshit mid range from the second he turned his back. That type of decision making, or lack thereof, needs to stop if Tatum wants to take a leap. 



**Move the Ball and Everyone Plays Better**


You will often hear the phrase ""the ball has energy."" When a team is sharing the ball and playing together, shots just seem to fall when they otherwise wouldn't. Role players get to ""feel the ball"" and get more into the game. Many times this correlates with more effort on the defensive end as guys get invested.  This is the essence of The Secret. Sometimes you just need to pass out of a drive so another guy can get a touch. True superstars trust their teammates in spite of their flaws.  


Your best player needs to set that tone. Tatum did it at times last year, but if he becomes a more willing passer, combined with his elite scoring, the league should be put on notice. Tatum is already a wonderful player, but he's got the ability to be so much more if he simply shifts his mindset a bit. As Bill Russell once said - ""I always thought that the most important measure of how good a game I played was how much better I made my teammates play.""",[OC] Unlocking The Secret - Why Jayson Tatum Must Pass His Way to Superstardom

While commenting somewhere else on the internet, an idea came to me...

It's pointless to swish a thousand jumpers during drills if you're not gonna use them in-game (i.e. because it won't work in-game).  He's practicing the wrong way. He should only practice shots he will use. 

Furthermore, trainers and coaches should not allow him to shoot any shots he won't use in-game, and he should not use a form/technique to swish practice shots that he wouldn't use in-game.  He's practicing the wrong way and receiving poor training and misplaced encouragement.  

If I were one of the coaches/trainers, I would create a unique training program just for him. I would spend less time having him shoot unguarded, and re-focus his training on shooting in drills meant to emulate 1-v-1, 2-v-2, and 3-v-3 games. It needs to feel as real as possible; he has to endure solid defense, and he has to move, dribble, pass, and catch.

Why should a trainer say ""good"" and let him continue swishing shots in drills and unrealistic scenarios, when they know fully well he's not really comfortable with any of that stuff? He's like that friend you have who doesn't really play ball, but in some situations can hit ridiculous shots. However, once a real game starts, hes useless.",An Idea for Fixing Ben Simmons

2567,nba,"Let me start by saying this: coaches are not mental health professionals. They are coaches. They have a single job: get the absolute best out of their players and teams.

Just like athletic trainers and team doctors are well paid to ensure that getting the best out of players doesn't lead to injury, and thus can supersede a coach on issues of health, organizations need to give mental health professionals the same wide ranging power to recognize when players are struggling.

We have no idea what actually went down between Jason Kidd and Larry Sanders but I have no doubt there are multiple sides to the story. Sanders was struggling with mental health issues that he later cited when he retired early, and Kidd was probably looking at a player with incredible physical potential who wasn't pushing himself the way he needed to be great. 

That strategy worked for Giannis, who he also was very hard on early (remember when he was benched for lack of effort?), and appears to have hurt Sanders. 

Instead of a major indictment on Kidd, who is not trained to handle issues of mental health, I hope this is a nudge to NBA teams to take mental health seriously and employ ACTUAL professionals to oversee these types of situations. Coaches should not be expected to do anything other than coach. They are not qualified.

To say otherwise is to say mental health isn't important enough to be taken that seriously.","If the story about Larry Sanders is true, the Bucks organization, not JKidd let him down"

Both had maybe subpar or (not really) bad seasons in their new teams. So their value starts to decline over the course of the season (Jeremy Lin, I think from his performance. IT, because of his injuries)

######**TIER 4: CUSTARD / aka the SWEET FILLING**

*In the middle of her trifle, Rachel had some homemade custard. This middle pack of teams may resemble custard in a few ways. They're the middle class of the league, filling out the room in between the contenders and pretenders. But more than that, the NBA's new play-in system has made it kind of fun to be in the 7-8-9-10 range these days.*

**(19) TORONTO RAPTORS**

*last year*: Nothing lasts forever. The Raptors had won 48+ games for seven seasons in a row (highlighted by the championship in 2018-19) but woke up to a nightmare in 2020-21. They finished an abysmal 27-45, although much of that fell on bad fortune. They had a strange year, getting evicted down to Tampa, and losing several close games. Their advanced stats suggest a team that was closer to .500 than their actual record.

*losses*: After 9 years with the franchise, Kyle Lowry is finally moving on. He's in decline now at age 34, but he still averaged 17-7 last season. Starting center Aron Baynes is also gone, with far less fanfare. He won LVP honors this past season, although every fan should still wish him well as he struggles with a neck injury.

*gains*: As a benefit of their disaster season, the Raptors had their highest pick in years and selected SF Scottie Barnes (Florida State.) Barnes is a below-average shooter, but he's a good passer and defender and may be able to help the rotation sooner than later. The team also acquired Goran Dragic and Precious Achiuwa in the Lowry transaction, although Dragic may not last long with the team.

*predicted record*: Before we project a record for the Raptors in 2021-22, we have to balance out their terrible season. If we normalize for injuries and bad luck, .500 is more of a reasonable starting point. I'd also expect the defense to vault back into the top 10 (after falling to 15th) given the length of their frontcourt. Expecting them to get into the top half on offense may be harder, especially if they funnel big minutes to Scottie Barnes and second-year PG Malachi Flynn. Both have bright futures, but they're still young players who will have inconsistency. Overall, I'm going to pencil them in for an underwhelming **40-42** for that reason. I'm also doing that with the presumption that Goran Dragic doesn't play for the team; if he does, then you can bump that up. Still, we've passed the days when we can automatically write ""Toronto"" into the playoffs, especially with the middle of the East getting stronger.

---

**(18) INDIANA PACERS**

*last year*: Despite solid results from coach Nate McMillan, the Pacers brought in rookie coach Nate Bjorkgren to help modernize their offense (which had ranked 30th in FTA and 3PA). Bjorkgren helped boost those offensive numbers some, but lost the locker room and lost his job. All told, the team finished 34-38 with middling advanced stats (17th in SRS, 14th in offense, 13th in defense.)

*losses*: For a team that has no problem shaking up the coaching staff, the front office appears pretty stubborn about hanging on to the roster. They did trade Victor Oladipo in midseason (for Caris LeVert) but have been awfully quiet this offseason. Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday are their only departing rotational players, with McDermott a bigger loss of the two.

*gains*: New coach Rick Carlisle will go with a defense-for-offense substitution, bringing in veteran Torrey Craig to fill McDermott's spot as the backup SF-PF. R1 pick Chris Duarte should contribute some on both ends as a 3 and D prospect. That said, the biggest difference in the team may be a matter of health. T.J. Warren only played 4 games last year, and Caris LeVert and Myles Turner missed serious time as well.

*projected record*: There's enough raw talent here to get the team back into the 5-6 range in the East (especially with Carlisle at the helm), but some doubts remain. In fact, the reason that I'm going with a lukewarm **42-40** is because I'm not convinced about the durability of the players. If you told me their starters all played 80 games, this could be a 45+ win team. However, many of them (Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Turner) have struggled with injuries in the past.

---


**(17) MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES**

*last year*: Coach Taylor Jenkins and the young Grizzlies continued their growth, going from 34-39 up to 38-34 last year despite missing Jaren Jackson Jr. for the majority of the year. Their advanced stats were mostly mid pack, but their defense ranked 6th overall. The team made the playoffs, but lost 4-1 to Utah in round one.

*losses*: The Grizzlies surprisingly traded away starter Jonas Valanciunas (17.1 PPG, 12.5 RPG) for Steven Adams, although that may have less to do with Valanciunas and more about other factors. The staff may be making some more room for Jaren Jackson Jr. as a ""5"" man or for sophomore Xavier Tillman to play a stretch big role. SG Grayson Allen has also been traded away. And while Allen may still best known for his college career, he contributed quite a bit last season, starting 38/50 games. Justise Winslow will also leave, with not much contribution to his name.

*gains*: In that Valanciunas trade, Memphis moved up to the # 10 pick. However, their selection (Ziaire Williams from Stanford) is more of a project than an immediate contributor. Instead, the difference in the minutes distribution will likely be a ""promotion"" to younger players like Tillman and Desmond Bane.

*predicted record*: On face value, the Memphis Grizzlies are a pretty good team. Whether they can elevate from there may really come down to Jaren Jackson Jr. as a wild card. People loved him as a rookie, but he's been injured and a little lost since then. He can shoot (which he proved in 2019-20) but his defensive ""fit"" is still in doubt. In theory, he should be a center, but he doesn't rebound well and he fouls too often to play 30+ minutes a night. If he can figure it all out, he can unlock a whole new level for the Grizzlies team. Until we see it in action, I'm going to have to pencil them in for a modest **42-40** record given the tough Western Conference.

---

**(16) CHICAGO BULLS**

*last year*: Chicago finished below .500 for the fourth year in a row, finishing 31-41 in Billy Donovan's first year on the job. There were some signs of progress though, as their offense climbed from 27th in the league to 19th. Their point differential (-0.9) was also not as bad as their record indicates.

*losses*: The Bulls lost a slew of rotational players from last year, including Garrett Temple, Daniel Theis, Thaddeus Young, and Tomas Satoransky. Wendell Carter Jr. and Otto Porter Jr. also left last midseason. None of those names may sound like big deals, but they all averaged over 20 minutes for the team last year. Lauri Markkanen may join them on the bus out of town.

*gains*: We all thought the Bulls made their big move in midseason by acquiring Nikola Vucevic, but it turns out that they were just getting started. They went on a spending spree this offseason and will be paying over $57M combined to SF DeMar DeRozan, PG Lonzo Ball, and PG Alex Caruso. It's an interesting mix of old and young, as DeRozan is 32 and Ball is 23. Still, it suggests the Bulls are going to try and make a playoff push as soon as possible.

*predicted record*: Adding veterans (even young vets like Ball and Caruso) to the backcourt may cloud the future of Coby White, but that's not necessarily a bad thing from a ""win now"" point of view. The Bulls gave White the greenlight as a sophomore and he took full advantage to the tune of 15.1 points per game, but his efficiency was still below-average and his advanced stats were still negative overall (-2.6 BPM.) Lonzo Ball should blend in better and allow his more efficient teammates (Zach LaVine, DeRozan, Vucevic) to shine. We may scoff at DeRozan's brand of basketball, but he was the main engine on a Spurs offense that finished in the top 10 each of the last two years. And it's fair to say Zach LaVine may even have more upside than DeRozan. He averaged 27.4 points on 63% true shooting last year, and looked every bit as good as Devin Booker in the Olympics. With the right team around him, he may take the same type of star leap. I wouldn't count on the Finals, of course, but **42-40** is reasonable given this lineup.

**(15) NEW YORK KNICKS**

*last year*: Tom Thibodeau's Knicks had a magical (regular) season, roaring to a 41-31 finish. Thibodeau unlocked Julius Randle's ability as a playmaker, as the big man jumped from 3.1 assist to 6.0 per game and won Most Improved Player in the process. Of course, a lot has been made about the sustainability of their defense. They allowed opponents to shoot 33.7% from 3, the lowest in the league. If you think that's ""random"" as some analysts do, then their point differential would shrink from +2.3 into the [negatives](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n41f76/theres_a_school_of_thought_that_opponents/).

*losses*: The team let starting PG Elfrid Payton go, which Knicks fans should be happy about after Payton cracked our ""Least Valuable Player"" ballot. The loss of SF Reggie Bullock should hurt more. Bullock was arguably their best three-point shooter, hitting 41.0% on 6.1 attempts per game. Presumably, the team prioritized re-signing their other free agents (Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel) more.

*gains*: The Knicks added two big names via free agency, albeit in very different ways. They paid big money to bring in SF Evan Fournier. Fournier didn't stand out in a short stint in Boston, but he's averaged over 17 PPG and shot over 40% from three over the last two seasons. Soon to be age 29, he's still in his prime. Fournier's former teammate (and new teammate) Kemba Walker is clearly *not* in his prime anymore, but he represents a good value signing after a buy out with OKC. Walker's taken a step back as a star, but he's still someone who averaged 19 PPG and launched 8.2 threes a game. He can still be a helpful scorer, but his durability is the big question mark these days.

*projected record*: Count me as a skeptic regarding the Knicks' hot shooting (and their opponents' cold shooting) last season. Their 4-1 loss to Atlanta in the playoffs showed that they may have been typical Thibs overachievers. If they just ran it back, they probably would have regressed and finished around .500. That said, adding Fournier and Walker are a genuine spike for an offense that needs it (after ranking 23rd last year.) Ultimately, their upside may be determined by third-year wing R.J. Barrett. He shot 40% from three, which seems pretty hard to repeat given his prior stats and his mediocre FT%. Still, the kid's 21. If he can continue to improve and become a genuine All-Star, then he's the type of player that can elevate this supporting cast into the top half of the playoff bracket. Realistically, I'll consider this a **43-39** team with the opportunity to keep rising if Barrett can.",[OC] NBA LAYER CAKE: ranking all the teams in the 15-19 range

Everyone read the parts on Kidd's tenure with Giannis and the Bucks. Half of the top voted threads are bashing on him due to the Christmas thing and Larry Sanders. First, yes, he was an asshole. I had a manager running me to the ground and to near burnout more than once and it's not good. Would be terrible if I had mental health issues beforehand. But let's look inside here for one second. We don't even need to go far, just check every Ben Simmons thread. Any Post-Game thread of the Sixers-Hawks or Clippers-Jazz series. The hot takes on Gobert and specially reigning r/nba villain Ben Simmons. The Simmons takes here would make any hardass coach blush. ""Oh, but we are not coaches, we are just a bunch of people on a forum"". We have more than one study that shows how people are more prone to express their thoughts freely while being anonymous. 

Kidd had a giant ego, and this led for him being a general asshole, but other than actually having a philosophy, what changes him for any people basically wanting to banish Simmons to China? Other than actually being in a position of power and having the balls, nothing. This sub is a hub to bullying players, and everyone acts shocked when a coach does the same?

I think the only team that‚Äôs all in enough to trade their picks is the Warriors. If they trade Wiggins and every pick they can still be young and keep their core while adding Ben.

And the Sixers would get 3 more picks or swaps they could throw in for a superstar trade in the future. Maybe they can get Moody or another young  player as well, tho Wiseman wouldn‚Äôt make sense for Philly.

‚ÄúAs for Golden State, I've always wondered about its real end game. Beal and Lillard would marry them to three-guard lineups facing major challenges on defense. Simmons and Green together could be awkward, though I wonder if we are over-fretting about that. Both are A-plus playmakers.

A popular narrative on the Kobe/Malone post today was how Kobe didn't have any playmakers, while Karl Malone had Stockton. 

I think this sub is too dumb to realize how having a dominant big man can have the same effect as having an all time PG even if Shaq doesn't average 10 assists a game. 

You can see in the link that nearly every shot the Spurs make is due in part to Duncan even if he never touches the ball. The mavs have 2 people, if not 3 people on him nearly every time he's in the low post. Half the shots are just the Spurs making basic passes around the court finding the open man. 

1) Capt Jack's first shot, Duncan is double teamed on the other side of the court and he gets a wide open 3 point shot. 

2) Kerr's 3 point shot is because Duncan is double teamed and Mavs can't make rotations

3) Ginobili has a nice drive with no rim protection because Duncan's defender is still bear hugging him with Manu driving to the rim

4) Duncan FTs

5) Ginobili gets a wide open 3 because Duncan's double teamed and makes a great pass out to the top of the key 

6) Jackson hits a wide open 3...because Duncan is double teamed lol

Anyway that's literally just the first minute, but hopefully some idiots here can realize how having a big man does open up shots for the rest of the team.","Textbook example of how big men can be ""playmakers"""

&gt;**Pop expressed the relief very clearly. Were you all at all fretting about the pressures that were building on him?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I wasn‚Äôt worried about him because he can handle all this stuff. He‚Äôs a grown man. I just wanted to win so badly for him and for (retiring USA Basketball managing director) Jerry Colangelo, given that for both of them, it‚Äôs a swan song from Team USA. And for Jerry to go out undefeated in the Olympics, took over the program in ‚Äô04 and won four Olympic golds, what an accomplishment for him.  
&gt;  
&gt;And for Pop, this is, in many ways, the cherry on the top of the sundae for his coaching career. He‚Äôs obviously still going, but the [Spurs](https://theathletic.com/team/spurs/), they‚Äôre not going to win a championship. Pop will be the first to tell you that. In many ways, this is sort of a fitting topping to his incredible career. To add a gold medal, just an amazing accomplishment.

 

&gt;**At some point, I imagine Bob told you, ‚ÄúWe might take two teenagers.‚Äù¬†Did that conversation happen, and if it did, what did you say?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, yeah. We had a lot of conversation before that during the draft process, talking about different players who we were interested in. Some of whom were older and ready to play and some of whom were younger, like Jonathan and Moses. So we went through all that.  
&gt;  
&gt;In my mind, there‚Äôs a good reason why people should not be the coach and the GM at the same time. It‚Äôs a model that has not really worked historically in the [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/). I think it‚Äôs the coach‚Äôs job to coach the team he has; it‚Äôs the GM‚Äôs job to keep the big picture in mind and also the smaller picture and sort of weave it all together. And you have to do that knowing that, especially these days, there‚Äôs going to be a lot of flak coming your way no matter what you do.

2739,nba,"
I def get that Embiid was expressing his frustration with Ben after game 7, and maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference, but I think Doc not having Ben‚Äôs back was a selfish move.

Coach Rivers spent the whole year telling the public he didn‚Äôt care about Ben‚Äôs scoring and that he should facilitate and play defense. Then the moment when Doc could look bad he doesn‚Äôt support Ben at all.

I know he didn‚Äôt explicitly slander Ben by saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure how to answer that question‚Äô but Doc knows how the media works and IMO this answer has a subtext of ‚Äòhe‚Äôs all yours.‚Äô

It seems like there‚Äôs a good chance Ben will try to force a trade even if a good deal doesn‚Äôt appear for the Sixers and I don‚Äôt blame Ben for feeling that way when the coach would rather blame him than share the responsibility (which Doc deserves as well for his rotations imo)

We were at each other‚Äôs throats in practice and ‚Ä¶ that was a case of frustration from both of us, mostly from him.‚Äù

&gt;Shortly after Jordan's return in 1995, Longley became one of his targets. The then three-time champion accepted nothing less than excellence, and had little patience for mistakes on the court.

&gt;""I told Luc,"" Jordan said after a few games back, in 1995. ""if he doesn't catch any more of my passes, I'm going to hit him right in the face with it. I'm going to start throwing them right at his head.""

&gt;On another occasion, Jordan threw the ball out to Scottie Pippen on a fast break. Pippen took one dribble and passed ahead to Longley, who lost the ball out of bounds. ""I told you,"" Jordan yelled at Pippen, ""don't ever pass him the ball on the break.""

&gt;When Longley suffered an injury early in the 1996/97 season, his absence was noted. ‚ÄúThat was when Michael‚Äôs and my relationship went to the next level,‚Äù Longley shared, in a 2018 interview with The Ringer. ‚ÄúHe realised, at that stage, how good my screens were‚Äîhow useful I was.‚Äù The Bulls won a second consecutive title, and eyed yet another three-peat.

&gt;In 1998, the Bulls had three centres on their roster - Joe Kleine, Luc Longley and Bill Wennington. ‚ÄúYou know what I have to play with?,‚Äù Jordan once said in the training room, looking right at them. ‚ÄúTwenty-one feet of s***.‚Äù Perhaps a bit harsh considering Longley was averaging a career-high 11.4 points per game, in addition to 5.9 rebounds and 2.8 assists.

&gt;However, the Aussie centre took the barbs in his stride, and ended up starting on one of the greatest basketball dynasties in history. MJ was going to be MJ; Luc wasn't the only one receiving the Jordan treatment. ""I wasn‚Äôt the only one he was like that with. It was the whole group,"" Longley said in 2014.","[Michael Jordan] ""I told Luc, if he doesn't catch any more of my passes, I'm going to hit him right in the face with it. I'm going to start throwing them right at his head."""

2874,nba,"I know this is obviously a very circle-jerky topic on basketball subreddits but I have I feel like venting about it for a second. It's absurd that the Celtics haven't signed Isaiah Thomas.

First of all, from a practical standpoint, this team needs him as an emotional leader. The biggest issue with the 2020 - 2021 team was the obvious lackluster effort and a total void of heart when games were on the line. It was hard to watch a talented team have no one to turn to to get fired up. Smart just was not that person. I don't think there is a player out there who cared more than Isaiah Thomas and now, with something to prove, I truly believe his presence on this team would help A LOT. Even if his role is more of a player-coach √† la Haslem, he deserves that 15th roster spot.

Secondly, the Celtics are are a target for a lot of hate from basketball fans. Either from a point of jealousy or various issues people have with Boston, a lot of people root against the Celtics. Doing the right thing by IT and giving him a vet minimum to help gas up this team is an extremely easy way to gain some good PR in the eyes of everyone from Celtics fans to people who want to see the team fail.

And lastly, from a Boston Celtic fan perspective, is there anyone else in the league we'd rather have as that 15th man? The team is young and talented and relatively deep with a bright future ahead. In a city that has carried the weight of curses before, I can't believe we're just letting a new one start to carry weight. The organization made the right business descision by letting him go for Kyrie but sometimes things are bigger than business. Give the little guy a contract. Even if it doesn't work out, we'll all feel a little better about it.",Isaiah Thomas thoughts

2885,nba,"I mean think about it, it‚Äôs the only plausible explanation left. What otherworldly hold does Haslem have on the Heat for them to continue to pay this kind of money for him to just ride the bench and bring a ‚Äúveteran presence‚Äù. He isn‚Äôt even playing and if they wanted to keep him around in the organization they could just offer him some kind of executive or coaching job but they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs becoming very clear that Haslem‚Äôs salary is a front for some illegal business happening in Miami, possibly sanctioned by the Heat themselves.

2894,nba,So I was thinking how cool would it be if you could put stocks on NBA players and I think I can make it work with something called ESPN rating which the formula is ( PTS + REB + 1.4\*AST + STL + 1.4\*BLK -.7\*TO + FGM + .5\*TGM -.8\*(FGA-FGM) + .25\*FTM -.8\*(FTA-FTM) I chose ESPN rating because it's a good way to get ESPN on board. I don't know how to make the website or how to market it but I know how to make it work ex: if I wanted to invest in LaMelo Ball and I bought 10 shares for one for a week and he went from a  **31.0** rating to a 34.8 rating then since he gained 3.8 points I would get $38 but if he lost 3.8 points then I would lose $38. I really want to get this done pls tell me if you have any suggestions or if you can help this is a dream of mine that I would like to make real,Let's make NBA Stocks
2895,nba,,Dennis Schr√∂der Playing Hardball with Rob Pelinka
2896,nba,"The 2013 NBA Finals was the most interesting series we have ever seen from Playoff basketball. Not only was it one of the statistically closest series ever played, but the implications the results would have on the basketball community were some of the largest. 

The series went a full 7 games; each of them bringing a new defining moment and each of them seemingly swinging the momentum to the other side. 

Game 1: 
Tony Parker's Dagger to silence the entire Miami home crowd, putting them up 4 with 5 seconds left. 
https://youtu.be/c6AKrqv_Yq0

Game 2: 
Miami evens the series, but only after a 33-5 run during the 3rd Quarter in an even game. 

LeBron's ridiculous block on Tiago Splitter comes from this game. 
https://youtu.be/QI8-PbK1wmY

Game 3: 
Even in another blowout, the teams were able to keep things even until the 3rd Quarter when the Spurs went on a 35-14 run. 

The Spurs would set a record for the most three-pointers made in a game in the Finals (Along with handing Miami their worst loss in team history). 

Game 4:
 Miami is able to even the series after pulling away in a 49-49 halftime game. The Heat had possibly their greatest game as a trio, with 85 combined points in a game that the Spurs scored 93 total. 

Game 5: 
The Spurs take a 3-2 series lead in Manu Ginobili's first start of the season. 

The Spurs played some of the best team basketball you'll even see in this game, shooting over 60% collectively (First team to do it since '09 Magic at the time). 

Game 6: 
Widely regarded by fans, players, coaches as one of the greatest basketball games ever played. 

This is the game known for ""...rebound Bosh...back out to Allen...his three-pointer- BANG!"" 

Easily arguable as the greatest shot to ever be made in context. If that shot doesn't go in, Duncan has six rings, the Heatless would've finished a measly 1-3 in Finals, and Kawhi would maybe have more rings than LeBron. 

This is also known as ""The Headband Game"" because this is the game that LeBron would lose his headband during and play the remainder without. 

https://youtu.be/XrOMCmk3d98

Game 7: 
The Miami Heat win it in 7 games, while LeBron ties a record for most points in a Finals Game 7 (37). This, similar to Giannis this year, allowed others to view him as the top dog in the NBA because he won (again) while being the #1. 

This also cemented the Heatles as an official dynasty when looked back on, by becoming the 12th team to go back-to-back. 

https://youtu.be/YRIMQi7X7mI

Tldr; The outcome of the 2013 NBA Finals had the greatest implications of any series ever. If any number of things went even the slightest bit different, Duncan would be the GOAT, Kawhi would have more rings than LeBron James, and LeBron never goes back to Cleveland.",The 2013 NBA Finals is the best basketball ever played.

&gt; But the Bucks were struggling, dropping a game to Charlotte on December 23, right before Christmas. Players returned to the locker room dejected, silent. Everyone was ready for the next two days off with their families.

&gt; ""Zaza,"" Kidd said, turning to Pachulia but addressing the group, ""do you think this was a winnable game?""

&gt; ""Yes it was a winnable game,"" Pachulia said.

&gt; ""And do you think we deserve the next two days off?""

Damian Lillard is not currently available for a trade and he has also not requested one from the Portland Trail Blazers, sources tell Zach Lowe of ESPN.

A trade of Lillard, if it does happen during the 21-22 season, is widely expected to come down to the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks.

The Knicks are almost entirely out of a two-team trade scenario for Lillard until Dec. 15 when players signed during the offseason can be traded. The 76ers, meanwhile, can match salary and have a proven All-Star available in Ben Simmons. But the 76ers are on the clock for trading Simmons, who they have signaled they intend to trade.","Damian Lillard is not currently available for a trade and he has also not requested one from the Portland Trail Blazers, sources tell Zach Lowe of ESPN.

2954,nba,"The Bulls have the 3rd highest payroll in the NBA this year. Awful strange because Lavine hasn't even made a playoff game in his career. They've committed to this core and I am left scratching my head. The east is the opposite of open. They had a chance to flip Lavine and Thad last year instead they decided to aquire Vuchevich??? Look you don't win in the NBA without one of the games best players. The last time a team won a ring without a top 5 player in the NBA was the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. The Warriors won with 2 of top 5 players. Brooklyn has 2 top 5 players. 

Lavine, Vuchevich, Derozan and Lonzo are all fringe all-stars but like the very low end of fringe. 

None of those guys are better than Holiday, Middleton, Butler, Lowry, Adebayo, Irving, Tatum, Brown.

I would even argue that Tobias Harris is better than any player on the Bulls. 

The east has 3 great teams that I think have the best shot at repping the conference. Thats not counting Boston, Philly or Atlanta. 

So at best the Bulls are the 7th best team in the Eastern Conference. I think Bulls fans being so desperate drove their front office to build around Lavine. Zach is a nice player but like I said he isn't better than those other players I listed above. 

I am puzzled at the attempt to go all in. This screams mediocrity. It screams BJ and Bogut bucks team. Yes the Jennings led squad wasn't as talented as this Bulls team, but the entirty of the league and especially Eastern conference were not nearly as talented as it is now. If you send this Bulls team back in time a decade they could get a higher seed, still couldnt win a ring.

I am not bashing their organization for trying to win. I am bashing their organization for trying to win with such a flawed blueprint. Look at the list of MVPs in that decade. The only player to have not  made it to the NBA finals is your reigning MVP Nikola Jokic. 

I am happy to see the Bulls improve and hopefully we can get this i-94 rivalry up and running again. But as an outsider looking in, one who has been a fan of a perennial 8 seed, this isn't how you build for a championship",The Chicago Bulls have a problem

The Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Timberwolves are among the teams who have discussed a trade for Ben Simmons with varying degrees of interest, sources tell Zach Lowe of ESPN.

The 76ers haven't progressed far with a trade of Simmons as they likely view him as their path to a trade for Damian Lillard. 

Simmons appears to be the only All-Star player truly available via trade as Lillard and Bradley Beal haven't signaled a preference to be dealt. 

Simmons is a two-time All-NBA Defensive First Team selection and three-time All-Star. Last season, Simmons averaged 14.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists in 32.4 minutes per game.","The Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Timberwolves are among the teams who have discussed a trade for Ben Simmons with varying degrees of interest, sources tell Zach Lowe of ESPN."

&gt;But the Bucks were struggling, dropping a game to
Charlotte on December 23, right before Christmas.
Players returned to the locker room dejected, silent.
Everyone was ready for the next two days off with
their families.

&gt;‚ÄúZaza,‚Äù Kidd said, turning to Pachulia but addressing the group, ‚Äúdo you think this was a winnable game?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, it was a winnable game,‚Äù Pachulia said.
‚ÄúAnd do you think we deserve the next two days
off?‚Äù

&gt;Pachulia couldn‚Äôt believe Kidd had put him in that
situation, threatening to ruin Christmas. Pachulia
tried to strike a diplomatic tone: ‚ÄúYou know what,
Coach‚ÄîI understand the frustration. We're all
frustrated because this was a game we were
supposed to win. We didn‚Äôt give enough effort. But at
the same time, this is a holiday. Christmas is
important to our families. It‚Äôs not about us; it‚Äôs about
our families. Guys have made plans.‚Äù
Kidd then turned to Dudley. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?
Should we take these next two days off?‚Äù
Dudley, too, gave a diplomatic answer.

&gt;But Kidd wasn‚Äôt satisfied. ‚ÄúSee you guys tomorrow at
9:00 a.m.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, whoa,‚Äù players said. ‚ÄúWhat do you
mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe're going to have practice tomorrow.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe booked flights to different places!‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. You guys get paid to do a job, so you‚Äôre
doing your job tomorrow. Things change.‚Äù

&gt;Practice the next morning was ugly. Kidd went at
Sanders. Called him a ‚Äúpiece of shit,‚Äù a ‚Äúterrible
player.‚Äù The team ran and ran and ran and ran, like a
college team would. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done that
since I left J-Kidd,‚Äù Knight says. ‚ÄúIt was not normal.‚Äù
Players had to finish a fast-break drill in twenty-two
seconds, but twenty-seven was the team‚Äôs best record. They did it over and over until they made it.
Some were bent over, panting, cramping. Practice
lasted three hours, and then Kidd made players lift
weights and do pool exercises. Half the team didn‚Äôt
know how to swim, but Kidd made everyone run in
the pool.

&gt;‚ÄúEverybody was so tired that nobody was thinking
about Christmas,‚Äù Pachulia says. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have
energy left to open gifts.‚Äù
Kidd continued to berate Sanders, though, calling
him ‚Äúpathetic.‚Äù Sanders couldn‚Äôt handle it. Where he
was in his life, his career, this practice, all his
mistakes, all his frustrations, he felt his entire body
turn to jelly as he cramped from head to toe. ‚ÄúI had a
full-body convulsion,‚Äù Sanders says. ‚ÄúMy body broke
down. Physically I couldn‚Äôt take it, and mentally I really couldn't take it.‚Äù

&gt;Sanders asked to be excused to the bathroom. ‚ÄúOh,
don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Kidd said as Sanders walked away.
‚ÄúWe'll wait, then run some more.‚Äù Sanders left the
facility and took himself to the hospital, spending
the night there. Few knew what happened in the
aftermath, and he didn‚Äôt have the energy then to talk
about it.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad person,‚Äù Sanders says about
Kidd, ‚Äúbut mentally, he kinda, like, brain fucked me a
little. It was a lot of, I love you, kiss you on the cheek,
now it‚Äôs all about money, who cares about your
mental health, your body breaking down.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm in a much better place now,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it had to go out the way it did.‚Äù

**Excerpt 2**

&gt;One January game, at Philadelphia, the Bucks
messed up a defensive coverage. Kidd thought
Giannis had made the mistake. Giannis respectfully insisted that it wasn‚Äôt his mistake. They went back
and forth, but Giannis stood his ground,
diplomatically saying, ‚ÄúCoach, I promise‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt
me.‚Äù

&gt;Then, at halftime, Kidd pulled up the play on film.
‚ÄúShow me,‚Äù Kidd said, confident he was right. But
Kidd was actually wrong: the film showed it wasn‚Äôt
Giannis‚Äôs mistake. Kidd still benched Giannis for the
second half. The Bucks were blowing the 76ers out,
so Kidd didn‚Äôt necessarily need to put Giannis back
in. He was making a point: ‚ÄúYeah, you're getting
better, but I‚Äôm still the boss.‚Äù

**Excerpt 3**

&gt;Little things were made to be a big deal, like two
seasons later, when center Thon Maker didn‚Äôt have
an iPhone, messing up the blue-bubble iPhone group
chat, and therefore once showed up late for practice
because he had missed a text about a time change.
Kidd was upset about it and made the team run
because Kidd felt that Maker not getting an iPhone
was an example of the team not being united.

&gt;‚ÄúJason had a brilliant mind,‚Äù says Nixon Dorvilien,
Bucks assistant trainer from 2014 to 2016, ‚Äúbut he
kind of made you uncomfortable around him.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen players go through it and it‚Äôs uncomfortable,
they like to say, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs playing mind games with me,‚Äô
but it‚Äôs not that,‚Äù says Greg Foster, Bucks assistant
coach from 2014 to 2018, now with the Pacers. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs
trying to get you to do something you wouldn‚Äôt
normally do. That‚Äôs coaching.‚Äù

&gt;Knight searches for the right words. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to
sound negative,‚Äù he says. Knight explains some of
Kidd‚Äôs methods, such as how Kidd would embarrass
the culprit of an error by making everyone but that
person run sprints for his mistake. ‚ÄúHe just had his
way of getting his point across,‚Äù Knight says.

**AW** = At Worst. **AB**= At Best.

**Lebron** \- AW - Top 3. AB - Top 1 (Nothing need to be said)

**KD** \- AW - Top 20. AB - Top 10 (One of the best player to ever touch a basketball. Made a questionable decision)

**Steph Curry** \- AW - Top 20. AB - Top 12 (High peak. Injury prone early on in his career, but he's still adding to his legacy so he can still move up from here)

**CP3 -** AW - Top 40. AB - Top 25 (High, but short peak in 07-09. Long prime and career. Injury prone)

**Kawhi** \- AW - Top 40. AB - Top 25 (High peak. Injury prone and needs more longevity. Still can add to his career and move up further from here)

**Harden -** AW - Top 35. AB - Top 25 (High Peak and good longevity. Needs more success, but even then, he can still move on up this list quite easily)

**Melo** \- AW - Top 60. AB - Top 40 (Great Peak and longevity. One of the best scorers from his era. Not enough success and no first team all NBA)

**D. Howard** \- AW - Top 55. AB - Top 35 (High peak in Orlando. Decent longevity, but fell off considerably quick)

**Westbrook** \- AW - Top 75. AB - Top 50 (Great Peak, not enough success to show for the stats produced. Hardest to rank here. I'm not high on westbrook, but i know some are. He can still move on up from here)

**P. George** \- AW - Top 100. AB - Top 70 (Great Peak, decent longevity. Not enough accolades as the rest of the players on here, but he can still move on up from here)

**D. Lillard** \- AW - Top 100. AB - Top 70 (Great Peak, but not enough longevity as everyone else on this list as he was a 4 year college player. Need more success and accolades. Probably the one player that can move up the fastest on this list if everything falls through for him)

First of all, compared to the other 3 major US sports, the NHL is already at disadvantage because they have a bunch of teams in Canada while NBA and MLB only have one and NFL has 0. Because of the amount of Canadian teams, the NHL has its fate sealed as the least popular major 4 sport in the US. Canadian teams in the playoffs and finals usually don‚Äôt do well for US ratings or growing the game either. So by expanding to 36 teams, the NHL would just be making up for having less US teams than the other sports. More US teams added also makes it harder for Canadian teams to make the finals, which is financially what the NHL wants. While NHL is obviously the biggest sport in Canada, most Canadian teams make less profit for the league than the US teams because of the dollar/currency difference.

Best all-around defenseman; bomb from the point, as well as from Ovi spot on power play

4. Pelech:  
Easily our top shutdown defenseman; smart player and sneaky offensive contributor 

5. Pageau: 
Swiss Army knife; plays 3rd line center, but sees time on both PP &amp; PK; very valuable player and another fiery, veteran leader; responsible defensively while also solid offensively 

6. Nelson:
Streaky scorer, but can carry us when he‚Äôs hot; underrated checker

7. Bailey: 
Savvy veteran playmaker; patient offensively (to a fault at times) and responsible defensively; quiet leader, setting good example for younger players

8. Varlamov &amp; Sorokin (tie): 
Excellent goalie tandem that keeps us in games and, at times, *steals* games for us (as Shawn had noted about Varly in his rankings)

10. Palmieri:
Likely to be a really good fit on the top line; gritty physical scoring winger who proved himself in the playoffs 

11. Beauvillier:
Fast, energetic winger; relentless forechecker with good hands (like Nelly, tends to be streaky, but also has ability to carry us for stretches)

12. Mayfield:
Big, physical blue liner; can clear the crease while also popping in the occasional timely goal

13. Cizikas:

14. Dobson:
Rising young defenseman who we‚Äôve watched grow up before our eyes; game has evolved in leaps and bounds, as raw talent has become more and more refined; would play top-4 minutes on most teams

15. Wahlstrom:
Natural scorer, who did nicely while learning on the fly how to play the forward position with a defensively responsible mindset; should benefit from playing on an otherwise veteran laden 3rd line, while also serving as a potentially lethal weapon on the power play

16. Clutterbuck:
Gives everything he has on every shift; hits everything that moves (in the other team‚Äôs uniform, of course) and will not back down from a challenge; best offensive finish on 4th line 

17. Martin:
Enforcer who sticks up for his teammates and rounds out identity line perfectly; winning player who understands how making physical sacrifices can lead to great rewards

18. Greene:
Veteran warrior who has helped mentor Dobber; plays more minutes than his body is built to withstand at this point of his career, but has a burning desire to win; the quintessential good soldier who will do what ever is asked of him

19. Parise:
Another fiery veteran winger and winning player; has roots on Long Island (with his dad having been a popular player and playoff hero here in the mid-to-late-70‚Äôs), appears to have plenty left in the tank; my gut tells me his career will be rejuvenated here and that he‚Äôll be considerably higher on my list before this coming season ends

You have $75M in healthy player salaries and you pick up a $6.5M LTIR contract to bring you up to the cap.  You can't exceed the $81.5M at the start of the season.  When the season starts, you put the $6.5M contract on LTIR and now you can spend $88M ($81.5M + $6.5M).  But that's only nominally, your real budget is still $81.5M, since the allowance to exceed the cap is merely to offset what should have been a serious injury incurred during the season.  My understanding is that this strategy is only full of disadvantages like leaving your final targeted player unsigned until the season starts and you can move the LTIR contract out of the regular roster and into LTIR status.  The higher LTIR cap hit locks in when you go over the cap so my understanding is that if you incur more injuries (e.g. a $7.5M contract player goes down long-term), you can't get an increase because you already got the LTIR bump. 

What am I missing here?  If it is truly an advantage, then every NHL GM would be carrying LTIR contracts to circumvent the real limit of $81.5M for \*healthy\* players.  I don't get it.",Does exploiting LTIR actually allow a team to *really* (not nominally) spend more than the actual cap limit?

This is probably the ideal outcome for Buffalo if they aren't able to get Mika included in the deal. Kakko/Georgiev are both very solid pieces to build with and Strome is that solid Veteran center that a young team really needs and could probably be the captain of the Sabres at some point.

3181,nhl,"Throughout this entire sweepstakes, it's been the dominant assertion that GM's are being too stingy, being unwilling to give a sufficient return for a player is most likely going to retire as a future Hall of Famer. I disagree, and the reason why is simple.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole point to trading for Jack Eichel is to add him to your team and complete it, surrounding him with the key assets you currently have. Asking for a 1st Rounder, a top prospect, an NHL top 6 forward, and a top 4 defenseman is a whole rebuild's worth of assets. A price that only very few teams can afford. And the only teams that can pay that price, are relying on those assets because they've built their whole rebuilds around them. And even if you're a winning team loaded with assets, those assets are exactly what you want to prolong the longevity of your Cup window. Yes, Jack Eichel is a Hall of Famer caliber talent, but he is still just one player. And that surplus of assets is exactly what Eichel and whatever his new team is needs to win, or stay competitive for longer. If adding one superstar player makes your team less deep overall, than how much did you really win? Plus, it wastes the opportunity of acquiring Eichel.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said before, Jack Eichel should be the crowning piece to your team. If you're taking Eichel, it stands to reason that you have to immediately go for it, because he's in his prime right now. Most teams won't be dumb enough to waste it like Edmonton is wasting McDavid and Draisaitl's careers right now. So if I was going for it, I would be doing everything in my power to put Eichel next to my top assets, especially since I'd have to be loaded with other numerous of high ends assets suitable for Eichel's price in the first place. Why trade Lafreniere or Kaprisov, when you can put either of them and Eichel on the same line? Trade someone like Kravtsov instead. Why trade Krebs or Suzuki when you could have that elite young one-two punch down the middle for years? Trade KK or Karlsson. If you're getting a player of Jack Eichel's caliber, you should be doing everything possible to trade to maximize the opportunity for your team as a whole and Eichel's potential by putting him next to your best players.

&amp;#x200B;

Trades need to benefit both teams. Yes, as I've said already, Jack Eichel is a Hall of Fame talent, but he is still only one player. If I placed Jack Eichel next to a top 6 NHL forward, an elite prospect, a top 4 defenseman, and a 1st Round pick, which if comes from a rebuilding team could potentially turn into a Hall of Fame talent that you could have for yourself since the 2022 and 2023 drafts are among the most stacked in history, which is the better choice from a team building perspective? If you're a smart GM, it's obviously the 2nd option. And Eichel is at the lowest value of his career trying to get a surgery that's never been done on a professional athlete before, which you could permanently lower his ceiling for the rest of his career if things don't go well? I mean, we're talking about Eichel's neck of all places. When you consider that possibility, doesn't it make holding onto your current key assets more attractive now? After all, those assets you have right now have created a great rebuild, so why ruin a good thing right? It's not like you won't be contenders anyway? Throwing all of that away for one name would be foolish.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I think a bulk return of high end assets, rather than a few elite assets is more beneficial to both teams. One team gets a superstar and can truly utilize him to the best of their ability, while Buffalo gets a large pool of high end assets in their right suitable for a true rebuild around Cozens, Quinn, Middlestadt, and maybe even Dahlin if he doesn't lose patience and asks for a trade himself. Now, you may disagree with me on this and think that going all in is the better option. And that's okay. But I hope you understand why I and many others think that a conservative trade is a better option than going all in.

one of my best friends (18) is currently playing in the second-best German youth league. He has faced a blow of fate lately. Originally, he was committed to move to America and play for a Tier II team before moving on to enter college. However, due to Biden's travel ban, he was unable to move in time. Subsequently, he was scheduled to move and play for a Tier III tream. Just now, news broke that he won't get his visa and will be unable to relocate to the US early enough to play at all. He is expectedly disappointed and naturally has quite some trouble processing the fact that his entire career just took a detrimental beating.

As I don't personally play Ice Hockey and neither know the league structure here in Germany, nor in America, I can't really connect with him on this one and consolidate him meaningfully.

Are there any personalities in America, be it German players who went to America or be it coaches with a big heart for an aspiring German who you would think we would have any chance to get in touch with and ask for some perspective and consolidation?

I know it's a big reach but I am very determined to help my friend through this tough time.

3428,nhl,"One of the most important aspects of hockey is getting onside or gaining offensive zone entry and this is largely due to the sport having a hard offside line which differs greatly than the offside rules used in football or soccer. 

On 5 on 5  or all other player situations play you want to gain entry in the offensive zone with a carry or pass with carry or you can simply regroup. The regroup approach is seen a lot on 3 on 3 or 4 on 4 play but it seems to be increasing on 5 on 5 play. 

However, it's necessary to use the dump &amp; recovery strategy or chip &amp; chase on 5 on 5 play as many times the defense will force you into that option. You see similar strategies in rugby kick &amp; chase or soccer send the ball deep and try to retain possession afterwards.

You may have seen our [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/olsma5/an_optimization_web_app_for_the_seattle_expansion/) on a website that optimizes Seattle's roster using point shares. Now that the protection lists have been revealed, we re-ran our optimizer and are seeing that Seattle may be on track to fielding a top team straight out of the draft.

Before I continue, I'm just going to leave this quote from Hockey Reference:

**""If you believe that any attempt to attribute team success to individual players is an abomination, then read no further.""**

You can find the website here:

[www.nhlexpansiondraft.com](https://www.nhlexpansiondraft.com)

If Seattle spends to the cap limit (\~81M) and purely tries to maximize the point shares of each player they draft - they can create a team with the most total point shares in the league.

More surprisingly, if they spend to the minimum of the cap (\~49M), they can still field a top 10 team. You can achieve a similar result on the website by dragging the slider all the way to the right.

3643,nhl,"This is the second time I'm posting this question on reddit. And based from recent happenings, this topic has brought to my attention. Ever since the Chicago Blackhawks spent over the cap vs. the Tampa Bay Lightning to get to the Stanley Cup Final, they have been criticized. Tampa Bay later, used the same tactic to bypass the Salary Cap by putting Nikita Kucherov on LTIR. Now, based from sources that Shea Weber might also miss the entire 2021-2022 Season due to injuries, the Montreal Canadiens are faced with exposing Weber and putting him on LTIR. This will force them to free cap space and acquire an asset or assets. 

I believe the NHL has now past that point that teams will more likely abuse the Hard Cap System. If Gary Bettman and top brass in the NHL want to correct this problem, I think it is best to introduce the ***Soft Salary Cap*** and ***Luxury Tax*** system. 

Here's how it works: 

**Soft Salary Cap**: A team can spend above the Salary Cap. However, they will be subjected to penalties and limited privileges going into next season. This includes the incapability of signing free agents during off-season. 

**Luxury Tax**: A team that spend above the Salary Cap will be subjected to pay a substantial percentage amount per dollar in a signing or acquisition.   


\*\*\*Note: Gary Bettman was instrumental with the introduction of the Soft Salary Cap in the NBA. With the Cap cirumvention possibly coming as more and more teams could use this LTIR to circumvent the cap, it is time now to place these rules.

3956,nhl,"In my opinion, the best example of this is doughty winning the 2016 Norris trophy. For those that don‚Äôt remember, doughty narrowly edged out Erik karlsson to win the Norris trophy for the nhls top defenseman that year. Had karlsson won, it would‚Äôve been his third Norris in five years, while doughty had been a perennial finalist but had never won it.

Doughty had a respectable year, he had 51 points, a 57 corsi, and played very good shut down defense on a still respectable kings team. I think he definitely deserved to get nominated, at the very least. 

Karlssons year, meanwhile, was otherworldly. He put up 82 points in 82 games, good for fourth in the league, on an Ottawa team that was terrible. Other players who put up similar offensive numbers like green or lidstrom tended to play on extremely talented offensive teams, but karlsson was ottawas offense. He put up a 56 corsi, which is solid, until you realize that Ottawa averaged a 40 corsi that season with him off the ice, meaning he carried the team every shift. The kings, for comparisons sake, were consistently above average without doughty on the ice. Karlsson also put up respectable defensive numbers that season, which was the one argument people had for why he wasn‚Äôt easily the best defenseman in the world. Particularly last season, karlsson didn‚Äôt only seem to lap his competition on defense, he put up arguably the best season of any defenseman of the modern era, challenged by only lidstrom‚Äôs 2006 season in my opinion.

So why did doughty beat karlsson? A few reasons. One, doughty made the playoffs, karlsson didn‚Äôt. As we‚Äôve seen, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that a defenseman is better, but it could‚Äôve played with voters. Second, karlsson barely beat doughty the previous year. And I mean barely, as it was one of the closest Norris votes ever. So voters were more keen on voting doughty this time around over karlsson because they felt like he was due, something more than one phwa member has admitted. (There‚Äôs also been accusations that writers were literally threatened to vote for doughty, but I can‚Äôt substantiate that).

He is an atrocious commentator with zero novel insights and more bias than our American news outlets. He was a garbage coach who was gifted a Stanley Cup that he had no part in by the great Scotty Bowman. He was a train wreck as the coach of Hartford where captain Pat Verbeek actually voiced his pleasure with the firing decision to the media after McGuire got canned. No one Hartford or around the league had any respect for McGuire and other teams would actually mock his status as a head coach in the NHL. He was then fired after 2 months as a Senators assistant coach. He coached an ECHL team to a sub .500 record and seventh place in the division and bailed on his 3 year contract there after just one year to become a radio analyst. 

I still have no idea how he ever moved through the ranks anywhere. He was clearly a terrible coach and still has no worthwhile hockey insights.

Not a fact junkie or anything so feel free to correct more for fun discussion. I was in my teens when we won the cup last!

-both Habs teams came into the playoffs cold. Roy lost his last 5 starts going in and the Habs lost 6 of their last 10 reg season games.

-both Habs teams had/have arguably one of the best goalies in the league (Price and Roy) 

-93 Habs had only 4 people above 60 pts on the season and were the underdog going into the cup finals with LAK. '21 Habs only had 4 players over 25 pts on the short season

-the 93 Kings were star heavy compared to the 93 Habs similar to now. Kuch, Stammy, Point, Hedman now.  Kings had Gretzky, Kurri, Robitaille, Blake etc

-93 Habs lost first game 4-1 and were again heavily thought to get swept in the finals. We lost 5-1 last night similar media coverage of david/goliath

-Roy also struggled through the regular season like Price did 

-the Habs traded away Sergachev in 2017 as a top defensemen for Drouin who will not play these playoffs. The '93 Habs traded away top defensemen Chris Chelios in 1990 for Denis Savard who also did not play in the playoffs to win the cup

-coaching changes in '93 from Patty Burns (RIP) for Demers was an untimely and unlikely cup contending move. Multiple coaching changes in 2021 for the Habs as well

4199,nhl,"Watching the NHL playoffs this year, some hockey fans have been reminded of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. That was before my time as a hockey fan, although I am familiar with the series mainly due to Wayne Gretzky. Instead, I‚Äôm reminded of the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals when the Tampa Bay Lightning faced the Calgary Flames. In fact, I find it eerie how history sometimes repeats itself. I followed hockey a lot more closely at that time and I have fond memories of that series. I remember a Lightning team that was really good but probably not the best in the league, and a Flames team that represented Canada as an underdog by beating teams they probably shouldn‚Äôt have been able to. I know I‚Äôm not the only hockey fan who has made this comparison, and I decided to expand on the concept.

If you compare the 2021 Lightning to the 2004 Lightning, it‚Äôs pretty even. I prefer the 2004 Lightning. Naturally, I‚Äôm going to be biased because I was a bigger hockey fan during their era. However, I‚Äôll explain. The teams match up pretty well. Can Nikita Kucherov compete with Martin St. Louis? Probably, because after all, they both won the Hart Trophy as the League‚Äôs Most Valuable Player. Can Brayden Point compete with Brad Richards? Probably, because they‚Äôre both outstanding players.

Both the 2021 Lightning and 2004 Lightning have fabulous supporting casts. In 2004, the Lightning had Vincent Lecavalier and Fredrik Modin. In 2021, the Lightning have Victor Hedman and Steven Stamkos. We‚Äôve seen Andrei Vasilevskiy perform as a wonderful goaltender for the 2021 Lightning. Nikolai Khabibulin was a wonderful goaltender for the 2004 Lightning, and was downright dominant when his team won the Stanley Cup.

Here‚Äôs why I give the 2004 Lightning the edge, and I admit that I may be wrong to do this. The 2004 Lightning had a veteran captain in Dave Andreychuk. Ruslan Fedotenko stepped up in the playoffs and scored the same amount of goals as Brad Richards and one less than Jarome Iginla (I‚Äôll get to that man soon). Based on these two factors along with the previously mentioned factors, I believe the 2004 Lightning could beat the 2021 Lightning, the 2021 Montreal Canadiens, and they did beat the 2004 Flames. However, it must be stressed that the 2004 Lightning vs. 2021 Lightning match-up would be extremely close.

Now, what about comparing the 2021 Canadiens to the 2004 Flames? You see, that‚Äôs the problem. The 2021 Canadiens are probably not as good as the 2004 Flames. Do they have anyone who is as good as Jarome Iginla? In my opinion, absolutely not. Tyler Toffoli is the closest because he‚Äôs a talented goal scorer, but I don‚Äôt think he can compete with Iginla as an overall player. Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield are talented young players who are coming into their own, but they‚Äôre not quite there yet.

I like Iginla‚Äôs supporting cast from 2004 as well. Craig Conroy was a great player in his own right, and Martin Gelinas was clutch. Shean Donovan and Jordan Leopold were also excellent contributors. Once again, I‚Äôm biased towards the 2004 era, but facts are facts. When it comes to goaltending, I think Carey Price has been great for the 2021 Canadiens but he can‚Äôt compete with Miikka Kiprusoff of the 2004 Flames. Just to give you some perspective, Kiprusoff won the Vezina Trophy in 2006 as the top goaltender. He probably should have won it in 2004 as well. Price has also won the Vezina Trophy, but I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs playing at the same level as he used to.

This is all my opinion and I would welcome disagreements. Who do I think will win the Stanley Cup this year? I believe the Tampa Bay Lightning will win it in 7 games. At this point in my life, I‚Äôm old enough and wise enough to know that a team who has fought as hard as the Montreal Canadiens will push the Lightning to their absolute limit. Based on my analysis, a more appropriate prediction would be to pick the Lightning in 5 or 6 games. I‚Äôm not going to do that, however. Here‚Äôs how I see it: if I‚Äôm right, it will be good for hockey. If I‚Äôm wrong, who cares.

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not my assessment is correct. What‚Äôs important is that this instance of history repeating itself is truly ominous. When the Canadiens beat the Vegas Golden Knights this year, it was reminiscent of when the 2004 Flames eliminated the best teams in the Western Conference including the Detroit Red Wings. When the Lightning advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals by beating the New York Islanders in an outstanding series this year, it was reminiscent of the hard-fought series the Lightning played against the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals.

Quite frankly, I think it will be justice if my prediction comes true and the Lightning win in 7 games this year. In my mind, the 2004 Lightning should have been so much more. The 2005 lockout prevented them from potentially repeating as Stanley Cup Champions. As an American hockey fan, my interest in hockey began to drift when NHL left ESPN and signed a deal with Versus for financial reasons. Versus wasn‚Äôt as widely available and it made hockey difficult to follow.

When you think about those factors, the 2004 Lightning had their momentum cut short. Actually, it was a byproduct of hockey having its momentum cut short. If a team from the Sunshine State were to become back-to-back champions this year, to me it would signal a resurgence of hockey across the United States. Then again, I can completely understand the fans who want to see a Cinderella team from Canada win the Stanley Cup. Much like the 2004 Flames, I believe the 2021 Canadiens will fight hard down to the wire. And much like the 2004 Flames, I believe the 2021 Canadiens will never be forgotten by hockey fans.",Stanley Cup Finals - Comparing 2021 to 2004

However, if you look at the Tampa scores in this playoffs you can see how well they can shut down the opposite team as well. Tampa won 5 out of 16 games by scoring only 2 or fewer goals while Canadiens only won 2 games be scoring 2 or fewer goals. Tampa allowed on average 2 goal/game this postseason and 1.6 on average in the last 2 series which is almost identical to Montreal defensive stats. The thing is Canadiens have not played a team this postseason who can shot down the opposite team as well as themself . That being said, I think Canadiens ability of shutting down a team or Tampa's strong offense wont be a factor in this series, Tampa's ability to shut down the opposite team will be.",Key factor that will decide who is going to win SCF this year(IMHO)

4258,nhl,"First of all, I think the games are going to be amazing. But, a good thing or bad thing could be that there might not be any heat. I think both teams are pretty good sportsmen. They have both had other team's players do them wrong during the playoffs. Barzal getting fined on Tampa and the Jets player getting suspended on Habs player. These teams don't seem to be filled with hotheads. Could be wrong though. Any thoughts?  


Obviously Habs' game is defense. One of the best goalies in Price. I also have seen that this team has a lot of heart and when they are motivated they will play harder and faster. They are great at stealing the puck and not letting the other team get through the neutral zone. Habs are most dangerous when they are close to the net.   


Tampa's strong side is their offence. Amazing shooters, they can shoot from far away or any angle. They play great as a team and have great offensive strategies. 

  
So it will be some of the best offense against the best defense. This is the game we want to see. 

Tampa won last year and they are very very good. I see this as an uphill battle for the Habs but they have been proving people wrong all along. There could be a whole new gear that we have not seen them shift into yet. The Habs will scratch and claw and make it very difficult for Tampa to make their offensive plays.

So I do not like Vegas out of the jealously of there immediate success and they eliminated the avs (my second favorite team) so I myself was not cheering for Vegas at all. Especially when there the only team the NHL ever apologized too and immediately changed the rule even as someone who likes the rule. I agree with the rule change because referee's should be given the opportunity to get things right in the fast paced sport.

So I've always liked Montreal as a Canes fan the first series I ever followed featured Montreal in the first round 06 series. An after Canes Avs and Oilers were all eliminated I was like ok go Habs go and it seems like everyone agreed.

I don't think I've seen hockey this united around 1 team in a playoff series. Even as a canes fan I still see people dislike us in playoff series but I rarely see people cheer for a team like Montreal. And its not like it is a hard luck Franchise they have 24 cups. This would be a quarter century of cups if they win and Leaf fans, Canes fans Avs fans Wild fans, hell I've even seen Boston Fans cheer for the Habs. The fact that there is 1 Boston fan cheering for Montreal is shocking enough but multiple.

We kept explaining to him that we would never know what would have happened if it was normal circumstances because it never happened and tat the Habs were skillful enough to knock out the Leafs, Jets, and VGK so they have played with enough skill and heart to reach the finals as a team.

Even the Leafs fan who was our friend wnted to see us do well for the county of Canada and could insist that his team wasn't good enough and was outplayed.

He still would not insist that this is reality and when I go on social medias such as reddit and youtube, I see everyoe happy for the Habs.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I get extremely annoyed when teams I consider inferior wind up winning against teams that I would consider better. This is not because I prefer certain teams necessarily (although sometimes I do), it‚Äôs usually because I feel that having success in the sport is at times arbitrary. For example, back when the penguins eliminated the capitals in the second round of 2017, I was extremely irritated. This was not because I liked the capitals, in fact, they‚Äôre one of my least favorite teams and I was pretty upset when they won the cup the following season. But nevertheless, it seemed obvious to me that the capitals were the better team, and they lost anyway. I had the same sensation last night, even though this series between Vegas and Montreal was much closer, Vegas was not only the better team on paper, but they had all the momentum, dominating the third period and the first couple minutes of overtime before a bad transition cost them the game. Of course, they could‚Äôve done more to win, but it all just made me realize how much the sport rewards chance.

I remember personally feeling relief when Tampa won last year, because it felt like the first time since maybe 2014 that the best team actually won. Maybe it‚Äôs because I have this reverence for hockey and hockey history, I obsess over shit like all time stats and roster composition, and I also coach, but I pretty much always want to see the best team rewarded. And I know the concept of who is best is arbitrary, obviously a team that finishes higher in the standings is not necessarily better than a lower seed, but I‚Äôve seen so many outright mediocre teams get hot and lucky at the right time, and I remember it since childhood. The 2002 hurricanes, the 2003 mighty ducks, the 2004 flames, the 2006 oilers, all completely mediocre teams who made the final in consecutive seasons when I was young. Maybe I‚Äôm being an ass, I just can‚Äôt bring myself to enjoy a final that doesn‚Äôt feel like the best teams are in it.",Am I the only one who gets annoyed when ‚Äúworse‚Äù teams are successful?

4399,nhl,,Seattle Kraken's New Head Coach
4400,nhl,"Disclaimer: These views are my views alone and are not a representation of fans opinions or views in the wider NHL fanbase.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been an NHL fan since the early 90's here in the U.K when Channel 5 had the rights to the Sunday &amp; Thursday night games along with the playoffs &amp; the Stanley cup, but after they lost the rights I fell away from the sport because I no longer had access to the channels that it was now provided on.

Jump to 2017 when I found out that the NHL had a streaming service and that access to games would be easier for me to follow it was now time for me to decide which team I was going to follow &amp; as it happens Vegas had their expansion draft so I decided they would be my team moving forward, now I have enjoyed being a Vegas/hockey fan immensely but as the seasons have wore on I have come to realise just how fucking toxic the vocal minority can be over such trivial shit.

Let's start with the whole **""Vegas Were Handed A Team""**

If it was indeed the case that Vegas were in fact handed a team (they weren't) why in the hell were they perceived to be the ""misfits"" &amp; the team that nobody wanted? Pittsburgh could have protected Fleury they didn't, minnesota Could have protected Reaves they didn't, the same with Karlsson, Theadore, Marchessault etc they weren't protected because the GM's of their respective teams at the times saw them as expendable thus not bothering to shield them.

They were the names Vegas were given to pick from at the time &amp; they did so the ""handed a team"" doesn't wash.

2. **""Hockey Won't Work In The Desert""**

Correct me if i'm losing my fucking mind but the Coyotes are in Arizona &amp; what is Arizona surrounded by? That's right DESERT &amp; that has worked for Arizona which in turn low &amp; behold has worked better for Vegas because they're in Vegas, a town built on entertainment.

Not only that but the population of Vegas have been crying out for some kind of sports franchise because unless you want to play golf or go to the strip (which doesn't normally skew towards family entertainment) Vegas up until the knights &amp; now the raiders were a thing didn't have much in the way of family entertainment. Now with the Knights &amp; Raiders though you have something that families &amp; sports fans can latch onto in Vegas so that the city no longer is just known for casinos &amp; shows on the strip.

&amp;#x200B;

3. ""The Golden Knights Get Preferential Treatment""

This one pisses me off because this is not on the team, this one falls solely on the shoulders of the officials who are officiating the games at the time, as Steve Dangle pointed out we are one of the teams in the league who commit very few in game penalties &amp; if the referees aren't calling the infractions we are causing then that isn't on us or any team in the league for that matter. (looking at you Chris Lee)

You want to stop the preferential treatment teams get in the NHL the Bettman needs to sit down with the officials &amp; tell them to do their fucking job &amp; call the games by the rule book &amp; not you know ""whenever they feel like it"". This is an officiating problem NOT a Golden Knights problem.

&amp;#x200B;

4. ""Seattle Won't Get The Same Deal Vegas Got""

Seattle WILL absolutely get the same deal Vegas got, in actual fact they'll get a better deal because this might surprise you they paid more money! Oh the horror, an incoming franchise pays $650 million &amp; gets a crop of seasoned vetern &amp; young gun talent's to choose from should GM's choose not to shield them during the expansion draft. 

What are they supposed to do ""Ok Seattle you paid $650M but for that all you get to pick from are players at each position that are bottom 6 at best"" It doesn't work like that, the team coming in needs to be successful from the get go.

If an arena doesn't have fans the team doesn't make money &amp; if the team doesn't make money the franchise dies before it has a chance to find it's feet. With how cliquey fans can be if it were up to them the NHL would be just the original 6 with a message to new potential teams ""NONE SHALL PASS!"" if they could have their way.

4515,nhl,"So I've gotta admit, I really like the 2021 Playoff format. The prospect of 4 independent divisions with each team being able to play any of the other 23 teams (24 after the Kraken start play) outside of their division is amazing! Imagine a theoretical Stanley Cup Final between Boston and Montreal (for example) in the modern era, a possibility that this new format allowed for THIS YEAR. It would be insane!

So I think that this format should be retained post-2021, albeit slightly altered. There's a way to make this format even better than it already is and allow for anybody to play anybody in the Finals. Pittsburgh vs Washington, Edmonton vs Calgary, the Rangers vs the Islanders, New Jersey vs Philadelphia, and of course the aforementioned Boston vs Montreal. 

Obviously, the NHL will be reverting back to the planned 2021-22 divisional alignment next season. Therefore, that must be retained in this new proposed format. The slight change that should be made is allowing only the top 3 teams from each division and then taking 4 wildcards, the 4 ""next best"" teams league-wide. This would also assure that the 16 teams with the best records will always make the playoffs (it's rare under the 2018-19 structure, but there are times where a team with a better record misses the playoffs because of the division/conference structure).

As for who each wildcard team plays, you could do the highest divisional champ vs the lowest seeded wildcard and work your way to the middle. Alternatively (and to make it more fun), you could have the divisional champs choose their opponent from the 4 wildcards. Obviously the Eastern and Western Conferences would be dissolved and there would be some debate as to what the Campbell Bowl and Prince of Wales Trophy should be awarded for, but I think those are just minor details to be ironed out later on.

There's some potential for higher travel costs, especially for a wildcard team that wins a series or two. But I would argue that the NHL has some extreme travel already. Take the two Florida-based teams playing in a division that's primarily based in the Northeast. Under the 2018-19 system, you could have a playoff series between Los Angeles and Chicago, which is just about as far as you can get within the same conference. And let's not forget that not too long ago, Columbus and Detroit were in the Western Conference and would have to play far off teams (such as Los Angeles) under normal playoff conditions. So there's already precedent for long travel distances, and this would not change much about that.

In summary, I think this would be a fun, new way to hold the Stanley Cup Playoffs. It would be a unique system amongst the Big Four professional sports leagues in North America. It would prevent a team from the top half of the league to be left out of the playoffs just because of the conference structure. And long distance travel that would be incurred by wildcard teams is already something that is allowed for in the 2018-19 playoff system.

A couple of ground rules:

Not saying any of this is likely, more a fun exercise we found ourselves doing and I decided to document. Don‚Äôt look too much into the division boundaries - they were kind of an afterthought and aren‚Äôt even balanced. We decided to not boot any existing NHL teams; even though I could easily see a few teams moving in the next couple of decades, that is a different discussion. Some expansion teams use existing minor-league team / defunct team names on the map - this was another afterthought, and all names / logos are placeholders. We put an emphasis on a location being geographically distinct, as this seemed to be an important factor for Vegas and Seattle getting teams.

The list, somewhat ordered from most-to-least likely:

1. Houston) A massive city that already has an NHL-calibre stadium. The location is geographically distant from other NHL teams, and the city itself has a metro area population of over seven million to draw potential fans from.
2. Kansas City) Very similar to Houston - geographically distinct, existing stadium, and plenty of nearby potential fans.
3. Quebec) Most likely Canadian expansion candidate. Aside from cities neighbouring Toronto, Quebec is the largest city by metro area in Canada that does not have an NHL team. There is historical precedent for what that‚Äôs worth, an existing infrastructure.
4. Greater Toronto Area) This could be in Toronto itself, or a neighbouring city such as Mississauga or, more likely, Hamilton. The biggest opposition to this would likely be the Maple Leafs, but all other parties (city and provincial governments / NHL) would only benefit from another team in Canada‚Äôs largest population centre. London ON is another option - though far less equipped to handle an NHL team, London is farther away from Toronto than Hamilton.
5. Halifax) Atlantic Canada (the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, PEI, and Newfoundland / Labrador) is debatably the largest region in all of the US / Canada without an NHL team. Halifax itself is the largest Canadian metro area outside of Quebec / Ontario without an NHL team, with a metro area of almost half a million people.
6. Saskatoon or Regina) The last Canadian city I could see getting a team. Very similar story to Halifax, with the Saskatchewan province not having a team, and both cities having large(ish) metro areas.
7. Atlanta) Third time‚Äôs the charm! On paper Atlanta looks as appealing as Houston / KC, though with both of its previous NHL teams moving, I would expect the NHL to be hesitant in expanding to Atlanta.
8. Juneau) A moonshot pick - a joke between me and my friend. Alaska is certainly geographically distinct, though to a fault. Anchorage would a better pick on paper, having a larger metro area larger than some cities with NHL teams; though, logistics would be a nightmare.  Anchorage would be by far the most remote location in the NHL, requiring even teams in the same division to take long flights. If Alaska ever gets a team, it would have to be in the Panhandle, and Juneau is the largest city in the panhandle by a considerable margin.

There are obviously more realistic locations then Juneau for the NHL to expand to (Hartford, Salt lake city, etc.), but I wanted to have a not-so-serious pick on the list.","A Buddy and I spent way to much time drawing up a 40-team NHL, figure I'd share our work here."

4576,nhl,"The NHL is no longer a sports league, it's an entertainment league, √† la WWE. We watch for the love of the game and we hope the strongest team wins, but ultimately it's a well constructed piece of theater with a predetermined finish, purely to exploit a fan base and generate profit. 

The joke is on every viewer, every ""true hockey fan"" as we believe wholeheartedly that something will be done about the officiating. We curse Chris Lee, forgetting he's essentially a mindless (and sightless) drone who's doing exactly what his boss told him to do. 

There will always be bad calls and missed calls, that's to be expected. But this isn't the case here. The league has tunnel vision for profits and ratings. If it means stripping the game of its rules and integrity, so be it. It is and will always be a business first and the sole intention is to produce capital. In the eyes of the league, this is exactly what they want; Vegas fans multiplying by the day due to their success and every other fan of the league tuning in to see what farce will take place tonight. 

And to all the Vegas fans, true or not, know that when someone points out the obvious bias for the Knights, it's not a personal attack against you, your team or your city. The Knights are simply byproducts of a corrupt system. I would hate it if my team was winning this way and everyone called it undeserved. On the other hand, it isn't wrong to point out the truth and at this point, there's simply too much evidence for any sane, rational mind to ignore. (See: Corey Perry's face)

As much as it pains me to say, the best response isn't to point out the blatantly obvious and expect a different result. The true answer and the only path to change is to simply stop watching. Until Bettman and the league see profits dip, absolutely nothing will change. In fact, it's more than likely to become worse and worse. 

I fully expect some (mostly VGK fans) to tear this narrative apart and call me every name under the sun, which is completely within your right. But rather than call me a crybaby or point out that this is ""playoff hockey"", a true insult to shut me up would be a single, rational, well-supported argument that justifies what's happening with the officiating right now.  

Truly, the floor is yours, I desperately want to be wrong and want to see fair competition, even if it means my team loses night in and night out. And for fans of any other team than MTL or VGK, I would love to hear your opinions/arguments as well. (I'm told Sharks fans have been ahead of the curve for quite some time now)

If I'm wrong about the officiating, please tell me why. But please try to do so using facts and logic, rather than emotion. I only propose the challenge, as I have yet to hear anyone with a true love for the game defend the actions of the officials/the league. 

The game is still exciting to watch, I will always love hockey. But win or lose, it's beginning to feel a lot like watching a WWE superstar hoist the championship belt above his head, knowing full and well that is wasn't an accomplishment, but rather a decision, made much earlier by a group of executives in the name of profit.

4703,nhl,"I'm from Illinois and years ago I went to a pub in Chicago for a concert and while I was waiting for the bands to start there was a hockey game playing on tv. It was the Blackhawks. So I was watching the hometown team in that town. I've never been majorly into sports but always pro wrestling and love going to events in general. I thought to myself at that time that it would be pretty cool to go to a hockey game and that it was something I could get into. I was enjoying watching it briefly on the tv.

So I've always had it in my mind to go to a live professional sports game but haven't gotten around to it. Come 2020 I was talking to an old friend whos into sports, (I don't have many of them not being into them much myself) and I was talking about how I thought it would be cool to go to a live Blackhawks game. He isn't big into hockey but he loves sports in general. So since everything has been shut down I have been considering what I could enjoy when everyone opened back up.

But I still didn't really know squat about hockey. I signed up for Blackhawks tickets and got on a mailing list to be informed if they would allow fans again. I decided I needed to start learning and watching. I subscribed to ESPN+ and was able to start watching games on there. I watched randomly whatever they offered. Wild vs Kings, Canes vs Lightening and so on. I got to see a lot of different teams. Couldn't watch Blackhawks games because of the blackout crap but I did catch a couple of games on cable.

Anyway I have been watching since the regular season. Just watching teams, learning rules, etc. The Blackhawks didn't make it to the playoffs so my next team to go for was STL Blues because they are the next closest to where I live. They made it to the playoffs but didn't last long.

Usually I would look at predictions for games and whoever the underdog was, that is who I would root for. Having not known any teams well. But sometimes if they were known to be a good team or have really good players I may cheer for them also, for instance Connor McDavid. I either want to see underdog teams win or good teams play really good.

Well it came to Leafs vs Habs in playoffs and I knew that the Leafs were known to be a good team and many had predicted that they may have been this years Stanley Cup Winners. Well they were wrong.

Habs beat the leaves and then they went against the Jets and the Habs were again the underdogs. I learned how great of a goalie Price is during these games and also how much fight and heart the Habs had in them. Maybe it was in game 2 or 3, I could really tell that they were busting their asses. And after one of their players got knocked down and the Jets player suspended I really wanted to see them win even more. Some real drama into it.

Now I am an American and living in Illinois but even though I am very patriotic, I am rooting for the Habs to take the Stanley Cup. Having watched their journey and seeing how good of a team they are to persevere, it's hard to not be behind them. So I want Canada to take it, then next year the Hawks can get in there ;-).

But overall it's great to be a hockey fan. Can't wait to go to my first game live. I also have my mom watching it with me and she is loving it. Love this sport and the league of the NHL, nothing like it.

I ended up getting Sling TV and that's how I can watch the games now, on USA and NBCSN.

God bless you hockey fans!

Oh also, I am 34/m if that makes any difference. The time that I watched the game at the pub I was probably 23.

Watching games one and two between the golden knights and the canadiens, there were a few missed calls but nothing super dramatic. Tonight in game three, it was something else. Obviously the blatant double minor high sticking call was missed that cut Corey Perry so bad he needed stitches. Also there were plenty of trips and slashes that were missed. Kotkaniemi‚Äôs penalty for ‚Äúhooking‚Äù where Pacioretty was blatantly holding his stick was close but any good ref would have known not to call that. I don‚Äôt know how much cash is flowing into the refs pockets for tonight but things better be evened out for game four. It‚Äôs one thing to miss a little call here or there on both teams, but to make it so one sided, and especially to miss the high sticking call that cut Perry, is absurd.

4733,nhl,"I went through some crazy stuff mentally the last 5 years so I wanted to rewatch some series I didn‚Äôt have a firm grip on. I watched all of Pens Capitals 2016 which is arguably the key series for the Pens run knocking out the 120 pt Caps.

\-  I thought the Caps were overall pretty competitive and shouldn‚Äôt feel too bad about their play, they proved why they were a 120 pt team. Matt Murray stole Game 3 which really changed the series. Games 1, 2 and 4 were pretty even, maybe slight edge to Pens and Game 5 the Caps were better os it could have been a different series if Caps pulled the lead in Game 3. I would say the Caps had the momentum after games 3-5. However Penguins in Game 6 though were easily the better team in both regulation and OT and the Capitals had no business erasing 3-0 lead (mainly due to puck over the glass stupidity by Pens). They came up with their ace game of the series at the perfect time.

\-  Kuznetsov was a ghost for the Caps despite being their regular season pts leader. In addition I don‚Äôt think the Caps 3rd and 4th line was giving them much. Mike Richards in his last season was washed. The Caps 1st line was good as they got a great start by Oshie, and Ovie started a bit slow but got better midway through the series, but they really relied on those top 3 guys. On the other hand the Pens obviously had the advantage of having 3 good lines to the point where Crosby‚Äôs was probably the worst of the three, he only woke up the last few games. You can tell the issues the HBK line creates, I believe in the first game Pierre is saying ‚ÄúWashington is going to have to adjust so their 3rd pairing D isn‚Äôt against the Kessel line‚Äù with Orlov in and out of the doghouse for them. But what are you supposed to do, put them against Crosby or Malkin line? In addition Washington lost Karl Alzner later in the series. The Penguins got a solid performance out of midseason pickup Trevor Daley especially when Letang got injured for a game. They make up for not having the biggest names defensively by having a lot of speeds and their forwards doing well on defense.

\-  It seems like the series opened up more as it went along, which probably played into the Penguins hands. The Capitals had a great defensive season but couldn‚Äôt really make the game ugly and driven by possession and cycling. When they succeeded they had to do it playing the Penguins style such as having low quantity of shots but great opportunities in Game 5.

I think if some things went differently the Capitals could have gone to 7 or won, but someone has to lose. The Caps probably had the best single line of the two teams but Penguins 2nd-4th line are easily better which really helped when Crosby line was so so. In addition Murray was better than Holtby.",Random thoughts on 2016 Penguins vs Capitals series

4782,nhl,"For whatever reason this playoff season I have noticed a ton of hate and saltiness directed specifically towards the VGK fans, and it has really confused the hell out of me. So I am writing this to try and clarify this incredibly odd wave of hate towards new fans of a sport that only until 10 years ago had almost no national reach in the U.S. outside of the few regions that had hockey in them.  


The majority of this misdirected hate seems to in some way incorporate the fact that these fans are uninformed, jumping on the bandwagon, or god forbid just new fans of the sport in general. And to that I say DUUUHHHHHHHHH?! Vegas is a town in the middle of the desert that up until the 50s wasn‚Äôt much more than a strip of casinos. You honestly expect the majority of the population to be familiar with a sport that they had no direct access to until VGK came in? For that matter you could say the same thing about all of the expansion teams that have been popping up in the south for the past 30 years. 


Now I grew up in Michigan playing hockey, and I am and always will be a hardcore Red Wings fan. Because of this, I consider myself incredibly lucky to have grown up in a place where that was possible. I love this sport, the atmosphere, the rivalries, the comradery, all of it. In my eyes hockey, while being financially one of the most limiting sports, has always had the most inclusive fanbase. No matter your team if you were a fan of hockey, you were loved, because you loved hockey. I remember when you couldn‚Äôt even find a hockey game on a national channel unless it was playoffs, and even then it was hard enough to find the majority of the playoff games. Hell the 2012 lockout almost sent the NHL back to the stone age. Now we have people complaining that some fans aren‚Äôt true fans. Newsflash any fan of hockey is a true fan, and when it comes to bandwagon fans, there will always be ‚Äúbandwagon fans‚Äù whenever a particular team is playing well. Not to mention, you don‚Äôt need to have been a fan of a team through their ‚Äúdark years‚Äù to be a true fan. The majority of new fans to a sport come about when a team is doing really well, and these new fans can rally with and learn the sport with that team. 

Like the majority of people, I had a bad feeling when the NHL said that Vegas was getting the next expansion team. I felt that it was too much of a tourist destination and that the locals would not be a large enough crowd to even fill a stadium. I WAS WRONG. I can openly admit it, I mean it sounded crazy right, a hodgepodge team of mismatched players, there is no way in hell they would even be a potential playoff team. Again I state I was wrong. Vegas as a city needed a symbol that they could rally around, and VGK was that symbol. Something that many of you may not have remembered, is that the Las Vegas shooting happened not even a week before VGK played their first game. Vegas needed hope more than ever, and those players, fans, and even the community at large rallied around that support. They came together, and even Fleury, a goalie I had personally written off, came out and stood on his head. The only town I have ever seen rally that much around a team is Nashville, and those are the most friendly diehard hockey fans that I have ever met.

VGK as a team, and Vegas as a city and fan base are exactly what the NHL needs. We need fans, we need outreach, we need to make hockey as open and accessible as ever. I hope the Knights do well for several more years, I hope the Seattle Kraken do well at their start, and I truly wish the best of luck to any new teams and any new fan bases that want to get into hockey.

4849,nhl,"Well, Vegas is making another deep playoff run, and once again people are upset because they were unfairly gifted a Cup-contending team by Gary Bettman's new expansion draft rules, or something like that. But that's not really what happened. Here's the team Vegas drafted at the 2017 expansion draft:

https://preview.redd.it/oq69jkeuwg571.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abdce4f88a07bc7a847bf4e2b7f9b85e668e058e

Note that the players with bolded names were **asked** to be selected by their original teams. It's by no means a very remarkable team, though it is enough to not be the unanimous worst team in the league. Compare that to this next team, which by my best estimate is the most talented/balanced team they could have selected at the time:

https://preview.redd.it/sc0my4k93h571.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7784b86a8bec02560bae2351c73cb4c54f25538b

Something to note, of course, is that I'm not an NHL general manager in 2017 with a team of scouts at my disposal. The Golden Knights had a very good GM and scouting team. Some of my picks are the same as theirs because I have to recognise this great scouting. Other picks I made might actually be terrible. But the point being made is that Vegas could have likely had a better team from just the expansion draft alone. Would this team be much better on the ice? Hard to say. But that brings up another great point, that even with the players available, a Cup-contending team was probably unlikely to selected.

The next chart shows the players basically gifted to the Golden Knights by other NHL teams (shown in red) for expansion draft considerations. Some of the players listed were given to Vegas as 2017 entry draft picks.

https://preview.redd.it/xyio7qc84h571.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a998df330da299f4ae5c1310e2e903d6bc3d8734

That's a decent amount of talent that Vegas was not at all entitled to. Other GMs gave the Golden Knights these players and picks so that they would select the bolded names, some of which may have been selected by the Golden Knights regardless.

The next chart will show (to the best of my knowledge) both notable and unnotable players that Vegas has acquired directly from expansion draft selections and other acquisitions that same night.

https://preview.redd.it/p2df8blr4h571.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fbbf0488a5f0cd74d322c8bab0b40a8c2cba775

&amp;#x200B;

It can be argued that Vegas could not have traded for some of these players had they not gotten such good players during the expansion draft. That very well may be true, but as we saw, Vegas's initial team wasn't particularly amazing, especially during the summer of 2017 when many of their best players now were not considered as good as they are today. The players in green were acquired by Vegas through great scouting and negotiating. The Golden Knights management knows how to take advantage of other teams, and **this** is likely why many hockey fans dislike the team so much.

Lastly, we will look at the current roster of the Vegas Golden Knights. Capfriendly has 27 players currently on their active playoff roster. Only 6 of them were drafted in the 2017 expansion draft.

https://preview.redd.it/db7e4n5o5h571.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e875b252669655b14a76232631a9180270fc533e

4 of those 6 players were **asked** by their original teams to be selected. 4 more of their active players were basically gifted to them that same evening. Another 6 were acquired through smart scouting and trading of assets the team acquired that very night. The remaining 11 are, what the haters might consider, the only fair acquisitions.

Yes, the Golden Knights did get rather favourable expansion draft rules when compared to previous expansion drafts. But it's bad for the sport and the league if a new team, especially one in a new market, is terrible in their first few seasons. However, the league did not give Vegas a Cup-contending team with the new rules. Several other GMs gave them some of those pieces on the night of the expansion draft, and the phenomenal management and scouting team of the Golden Knights has done the rest. I know most of you probably already knew that, but I thought it would be fun and interesting to put this together, and to act as a point of reference if the Seattle Kraken also manage to fleece the other 30 NHL teams this summer.",In defense of the Vegas Golden Knights

4878,nhl,"After hearing why the Canadian division is cr4p compared to the rest, I implemented IIHF historic rankings to take into account how well each team performed the past 4 years. 

Teams were ranked at the end of the regular season (1 to n) and converted to percentile rank. 1st got 100, 2nd got 30/31, etc.

Each year was then multiplied by a factor (1,0.75,0.5, 0.25) depending on which year back they were. For instance, in 2017/18, NSH was the top team in the regular season, getting 100pts, but as it was 4 years ago, it was multiplied by 0.25, while in 18/19, they were 7th (80.6pts) normalized to 40.3, 19/20 they were 19th (41.9pth) normalized to 31.5, and 20/21 were 12th (61.3 pts) normalized to 61.3, for a 4yr total of 158.01. 

Thus, if a team were president's trophy winners 4 years in a row, they would get 250 pts for a 4 yr ranking.

I then compared their 4 yr historic performance with how they performed in the current playoff year.

It is interesting to see, the 4 Canadian teams rank in the past 4 yrs:

TOR - 7th this year, WIN - 10th, EDM - 14th, and MTL - 21. which shows that 3 of the teams correctly made the playoffs, and the 4th team should have been golfing by now, but for a good Price.

What's more interesting is seeing how they ranked the previous year. 3 of the 4 teams in the semi-finals last year return, while Dallas, who lost in the final, did not qualify this year, while the current underdog is MTL.

4932,nhl,"The Montreal Canadiens finished 4th in the in the North division and thus attained the last playoff spot. They got 24 wins with 20 of those in regulation in the regular season.

The Calgary Flames finished 5th and missed the playoffs. They got 26 wins with 22 of those in regulation.

Despite Montreal having less wins and also less regulation wins than Calgary, they made the playoffs with 59 points ahead of Calgary's 55 points due to having many more overtime/shootout loss points.

This example is a big flaw that shows that the current point system in the NHL is unfair. It rewards losing and allows teams to make the playoffs by losing in overtime/shootout.

Another flaw is that when teams are tied near the end of the 3rd period, they are more likely to play  conservatively knowing that by reaching overtime, they will get at least one guaranteed point. In the old point system when ties were allowed, this did not happen. Simply finishing the game tied after regulation did not automatically guarantee either team a point.

A simple way to remove both of these flaws in the current system is for the loser to get 0 points in all cases and for a shootout win to be reduced to 1 point for the winner. 2 points for a reg or OT win would remain the same. This point system is simpler than the current one and is also closer to the old system with ties in that when the game remained tied after overtime the most a team could earn was 1 point. The addition of the shootout after should really determine which team gets to keep their 1 point.

One sticking point for some is that reg season overtime is played 3 vs 3 now and some feel this is not ""real"" hockey and games should not be decided this way. This isn't really a flaw of the point system but rather a subjective opinion on the best way to break a tie. And knowing that the NHL will not go back to ties and won't remove shootouts, no point system will change one's opinion of 3 vs 3 overtime. There's nothing inherently wrong or less ""real"" about 3 vs 3 play. Some teams will be better at it than others but that would apply to all other facets of the game. It can be avoided by winning in regulation. Now I do think it would be more fair for overtime to be longer and to start at 4 vs 4 before going to 3 vs 3.

Some people have suggested that regulation wins be changed to 3 points. However, this would cause the maximum number of points a team could get in one season to suddenly increase by a lot and it would make it impossible to compare to past season point totals. It would also mess up records. Plus it doesn't remove the flaw of teams being able to possibly make the playoffs by losing.",Is it fair that the Montreal Canadiens are in the 2021 playoffs?

But in most places ive browsed through, ive seen nothing but condescending attitudes towards the north division about how weak it was etc.

So today i decided to peak my curiosity, and i noticed that the last placed canada team was Vancouver at 23 overall, each division has teams below canada, so at that point, the north division is the highest placed last place. Idk if that's the proper terminology or not.

Now its very clear to see, that in terms overall throughout the division, that the division collectively as a whole isnt as good as top teams in other divisions. 

But to objectively say its a weak division as a whole just doesnt seem to add up, as you could potentially argue the case that either all teams throughout the division had the ability to be competitive with each other or that yes the collective is that the division just sucks. 

I bring this up, mostly due to montreal, im trying to see what knowledgeable hockey fans think of them, last seeded team, but clearly proved they can take on the teams in the division.

Now they go up against either the avs or the knights in the semi finals, the teams that placed 1 and 2, respectively. Obviously looking at the standings, youd think that well of course one of the top 2 teams will likely beat the 18th seeded team.

Its the playoffs so of course we never know, but im genuinely curious to think of other peoples thoughts in the matchup of either the avs/kinghts vs the habs.

Are people selling the Canadians short, or is it likely that the habs will be eliminated by either of them?

I visited each team subreddit to see how common it was to have a rule explicitly forbidding hate speech. A bit sad to see that less than half (14/32) of NHL team subreddits follow suit with [r/hockey](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/) to set parameters on the language used here in Reddit sports banter.

Anyway, here is the breakdown. To qualify, a subreddit must have a rule clarifying that they will not tolerate (racist/ethnic/sexist/homophobic/transphobic) slurs, or any type of hate speech in general. There were a few subreddits that came close ‚Äî arguably addressing at least spirit of the rule ‚Äî but fell short of indistinguishably marking hate speech as impermissible.

Small notes on the Panthers, Wild, and Blues:

* [r/FloridaPanthers](https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaPanthers/) forbids ""Uncivil Participation,"" detailing that there should be ""no harassing or bullying"" but does not explicitly forbid hate speech
* [r/wildhockey](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildhockey/)'s Rule #1 is titled ""No individual attacks,"" and forbids ""relentless inflammatory comments,"" but does not explicitly forbid hate speech
* [r/stlouisblues](https://www.reddit.com/r/stlouisblues/) forbids ""Trolling/Witchhunting,"" detailing that ""name-calling includes use of the word r\*tard as an insult"" (censorship mine)

Whether your team's sub does or doesn't currently have a hate speech policy, let's all try to remind ourselves to keep our insults civil. No matter which player you're targeting, there's plenty of fodder that doesn't belittle entire groups of people.",How many NHL team subreddits have rules *explicitly* against hate speech?

After seeing many players get absolutely wasted by hits of questionable legality along with just plain illegal ones, would there ever be a push to have suspensions match the length of time that a player is out for if you injure them? 

Example A: break a guys thumb with a blatant slash, he's out for 4 weeks. Offending player is suspended until the injured player is put on a game day roster.

Example B: Ol' Bert, sucker punches a kid in the back of the head and ends up breaking his neck. Kid's career is done. Bert is suspended indefinitely.

Down sides:

This would require medical proof that the player isn't sandbagging an injury, but I'd hope that these guys are enough of competitors to want back in the game as soon as they can, possibly even earlier than a normal person may go back.

I also acknowledge that accidents happen (ex: Perry smashing into Travares) so this would likely only be for already suspension worthy incidents and perhaps expanding it a bit to include penalties from incidences that remove a player from the game.

We spend so much time arguing the merits of a hit, trying to decide if it‚Äôs clean or dirty, whether the player is a repeat offender, yada yada yada.

I thought the best system is one which is simple and  regulates itself.  Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with so far. (Apologies if I‚Äôve stolen anything from elsewhere . )

Simply put, it‚Äôs an eye for an eye. If you hurt a guy, regardless of whether it‚Äôs a clean or dirty play, you sit as long as he‚Äôs out. If it‚Äôs a few games, you‚Äôre out too. If you end his career, yours is done too.

The flaw here is in the case of trading off a third or fourth liner for a Mcdavid. It‚Äôs not fair to have a non-impact player taking out a star, so the punishment is also multiplied by a factor based on salary . If I put McDavid out for a month, and I make a measly $1m per year, I‚Äôm out for a year.  It isn‚Äôt fractional in the other direction.  One to one is the lowest ratio.

5277,nhl,"Many years ago, the NHL changed the Icing rule.  Previously, both teams race to the dumped-in puck, and if the defense gets it first it's icing.  If the offense gets it first it's live.  The NHL realized that there were a LOT of injuries resulting from this, and they changed it.  Now it's an automatic icing IF the defense beats the offense to a certain place on the ice.  That protects the **defending** player from getting absolutely hammered.  I think it's a good rule.

In my kid's minor hockey and in beer leagues, it goes further than that.  It's an automatic icing ALWAYS.  If the attacking team last touched it on their side of centre, and it crosses the opposing red line, it's automatic icing.  This protects **both** the attacking player and the defending player.  I don't know what other levels of hockey use automatic icing, but if it can prevent incidents like Evans/Scheifele, it should be worth considering.",Perhaps another rule change to icing should be implemented
5278,nhl,"I want to talk about the dirty hit by Mark Scheifele on Jake Evans on in the first game of the playoffs between the Winnipeg Jets and the Montreal Canadians. If you didn't see the hit, I suggest watching it. Spoiler alert, it might be hard to watch:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw4R900yT3g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw4R900yT3g)

For a minute I really thought Jake Evans was dead on the ice. That we really had a case where a player died after a dirty hit on the head at full speed. The way his head turned, the way Scheifele hit him, the way Evans fell on the ice. So hard with lots of speed and momentum. I was so relieved that he was in fact still alive.

Whether Evans should have protected himself more or not is absolutely irrelevant and a totally ridiculous comment. In real life, outside the rink, this hit would be considered attempted murder. And you won't blame the victim for not protecting him/herself more. The aggressor is at fault here. Scheifele committed the crime of trying to kill Jake Evans. Period.

There shouldn't be two sets of laws in Canada. One for hockey players, and one for the rest of us. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had hit someone this hard in the middle of the street, chances are pretty high he would be charged for attempted murder.

At some point we have to realize these types of hits are nothing close to a sports gesture. It undermines hockey around the world. In what other sport is this considered ok to skate 200 feet and hit a guy directly on the head at full speed? None, as it should be. Scheifele totally lost it and his case should be made a clear example for the future of the league and of this sport, right here in Canada.

I would love to see a Canadian prosecutor to charge Scheifele with ""Attempted to commit murder"" under the Criminal Code. Which is a thing for all Canadians, and it should apply to hockey players as well. Otherwise, these prosecutors are all completely asleep. 

Also, the NHL is 100% responsible for this. I suggest these changes to the NHL Player Safety department, and for the Players' association to impose it to the league. It's time you guys claim your safety back. It's not normal that in 2021 you don't know if someone will try to kill you simply for scoring a goal when you hit the ice, and that he might be fined some stupid $5000 for it.

**What I would change now:**

For any dirty hit on the head, the NHL should be automatically fined 20 million dollars. This money should go to help actual and past players who have lost their careers (and a lot of money) because of symptoms of concussion, along with all the trauma, suffering and lost of salary that comes with it. 

The club at fault, here the Jets, should be fined 5 million dollars. This money should also go to help victims of dirty hits, on prevention, training, etc.

The coach at fault should be fined $500,000. Put that money in the second bank below.

The player at fault should be automatically suspended for the season, including the playoffs. A fine equivalent to 70% of his annual salary should apply.

Some would think this is quite exaggerated. Compare that to life in prison for attempted murder, and you'll quickly realize it's not that much. Also, no player would want his coach to lose $500k, his team $5 millions, waste a complete season AND the playoffs, and cash in 30% of his paycheck only. 

Dirty hits like the one on Evans ruin careers, lives, families. Many players had to leave the game early because of it. They lost tons of money in the process. They shouldn't be the only ones deeply impacted financially by this. The aggressors should get a huge fine automatically and this money should go to the victim of the hit. So this is the second ""bank"". The coach+player fines should go directly to the player victim of a dirty headshot.

Now. Anyone who read this far would say the title and intention of this post is not in line with ""fines"" from a self regulated corporation. The NHL and their representatives are not above the law after all, and they are not lawmakers. Should criminal justice be applicable under the Canadian Criminal Code? Yes, totally. Especially in cases like this one. But by elevating fines to a realistic level, so many players would calm down. Coaches wouldn't let their players play dirty anymore. The league would pressure teams, coaches, players‚Ä¶ it would have a deep and immediate impact that would trickle down to junior hockey and elevate this sport we all love. 

You want to play dirty? Play in your garage. Hit your head on the wall I don't care. The NHL is a pro league, and it doesn't need you. It never did. Goons and dirty players have ruined this game for too long. This is 2021. This is modern hockey and the NHL needs to step up.

5305,nhl,"We can all agree that seeing Jake Evans on the ice knocked out cold was a scary sight and was very unfortunate. But if you put aside the emotion and bias for a minute and put all the context on the table, you‚Äôll realize that this hit did not have malicious intent, nor was it necessarily ‚Äúdirty‚Äù. Mark has no prior history of suspension nor is he known as a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù player. He‚Äôs very respected amongst the league for his attitude and passion towards the game. In a one goal playoff game with your goalie pulled and a player getting the puck in your zone, you could expect any player to want to back check hard and try to get that player off the puck, whether it be body on body or stick on stick. In this case Mark chose the body and had every right to do so. He glided from the top of the circle (atleast 6-10 feet) and made the split second decision to try and knock Jake Evans off the puck with a textbook hit, shoulder in chest. Mark‚Äôs feet did not leave the ice until after contact was made, which is standard for most hard hockey hits. The puck did not end up in the net until Mark was inches away and already committing to the hit. Most players in Jake Evans position would have had the wherewithal to have their head up and brace for some type of contact as you can expect the other team to be hustling back trying to get you off the puck by any means necessary to go and try to tie the game. Evans unfortunately put himself in a very scary position and took the worst of Scheifele‚Äôs heavy hit, leading to his head hitting the ice after going airborne. Now could Mark have just let up and let him end the game? Sure, but why should he, and would you expect him too? Or maybe he should‚Äôve just went for his stick instead? Maybe, but he had every right to go for the hit too. Hockey is literally a game of inches and split second decisions, and I think people should look at this situation with much more nuance rather than try and peg Scheifele as ‚Äúdirty‚Äù or act like he had any intent to injure. It was an unfortunate play that let to an even more unfortunate injury, but I think if you really look at all the factors and put emotions and bias aside, this post shouldn‚Äôt be controversial. IMO I think Mark Scheifele should get no more than a 2 game suspension. Prayers for Jake Evans and his family, let‚Äôs all hope for a speedy recovery. What are all your opinions?

5357,nhl,[deleted],"At the risk of beating a dead horse, how much does this playoff format suck?"
5358,nhl,"Kinda random and mostly just for fun, what if that trade were to happen in some ways in makes sense. There cap hits are identical and eichel wants out of Buffalo so the Sabers kinda have to move him. And for Toronto they might have to urge to shake up there core and adding eichel would allow them to move Tavares to the wing considering he‚Äôs getting older and generally it can be Beneficial to move older centres to the wing. Kinda like with Giroux. 

Now I‚Äôd believe that the leafs would have to pay more for Eichel than just Marner. Probably like Marner 1st and a 2nd for eichel. Seeing that Eichel is a centre and in my opinion can impact the game more and has done well in Buffalo with no talent around him(besides reinhart, olofsson,dahlin). And I believe he will do more in Toronto that what Marner is doing now. Also Marners no move clause isn‚Äôt in effect till 2023-2024 so he doesn‚Äôt have a say. And I haven‚Äôt checked to see if Eichel has a no move but let‚Äôs be honest he‚Äôll go anywhere at this point. 

Reasons for the trade not to happen. Toronto doesn‚Äôt have a first round pick this year(traded to cbj for foligno). Next year they will most likely be in the same division (Atlantic) and generally you don‚Äôt do HUGE trades within your division. And the last point is the Nylander factor, They would most likely move Nylander seeing he‚Äôs the cheaper cap hit, and has the higher trade value per his contract compared to what Marners trade value per contract is. And what I mean by that is Nylander can fetch a fetch a decent return right now because he‚Äôs cap hit is lower than Marners, and he performed well in the playoffs as marner did not.

My first thought is no it shouldn't. Equal punishment for equal misconduct. But an equal length suspension isn't always an equal punishment. Consider this:
Player A is  top-6, makes $8M, play 20mins per game. Player B is bottom-6, in and out of the line-up and only plays half of season, makes $800k, and plays 10mins per game. Both players have a history of suspensions, commit a similarly offense, and receive a 10 games suspension (let's call it an even 1/8 of the season). Player A will forfeit $1M, and miss 200mins of ice time. Team A will have lost a top-6 player and replaced him with a bottom-6 for 10games. Player B will forfeit $100k and miss 50mins of ice time. Team B will have lost a bottom-6 player and replaced him with an equal caliber player for 5games.

Since Draisaitl regularly features in the German sports press I watched some Oilers Highlights and I really liked it. So I started watching this year's World Cup and I'm starting to really really like it. 

But since I never watched a NHL Game in Full (Will start with it as soon as possible) I have some questions

How good are the German players? 
I guess Draisaitl is good, cause otherwise the German sports media would take notice. But how good is he? Is he a franchise player or just a really good role player. 

And how good are the other Germans. From what I gathered from the press Kahun and Rieder are the best players behind Draisaitl. Are they key pieces in their teams? 

And how about the rest? Anything noteworthy there? 

Is there a comparable player to LeBron James in the NBA? And could it be that ICE Hockey is not as superstar driven as Basketball and Soccer?

And what NHL Team should I choose to support?
Also what Team should I love to hate?

5783,nhl,"Firstly, I'll almost always be of the opinion that 20 years old is too young to be a captain. Naming him that 5 years ago was a mistake and 5 years later, I didn't see a captain out there. No one is going to take anything from McDavid. He's one of the best to ever play the game and is in the talks for best all time. But being really good at hockey doesn't make you a leader of men. Being really good at hockey doesn't make men want to rally behind you, and sacrifice everything for the cause. 

Remember when the Flyers went all the way to the finals, including a 3- 0 down comeback? Who were the top talents on the team- Richards, Carter, Gagne, Briere and a really young giroux. None of those guys come even close to  McDavid Draisaitl. But why did they go far? Because Mike Richards was an absolute savage that rallied the boys to make some magic happen. 

Think of that clip that's going around where McDavid is talking crap about Puljarvi to the coaches. Do you think a captain would deal with it that way? Or would they go right up to Puljarvi and call him on his shit, and then inspire him? I'm sorry but what I saw In this series was a much more united Winnipeg team, with heart on their shoulder guys like Scheiffele and ehler, vs a talented but isolated McDavid draisaitl Smith. 

The point of this post is that if McDavid had a 2010 Mike Richards on the team, and his only goal was to light the lamp, this would be a much better team. He would be able to focus on what he does best-creating plays and scoring opportunities. Let someone else handle the responsibility of firing up the squad.",Is McDavid not leadership material?
5784,nhl,"As title says, this is an extremely basic analysis of GF vs. GA in the regular season and how it is affecting the current playoffs.  I found it interesting and decided to share.  There is obviously a lot more that goes into these numbers, for example does Colorado truly have a better defense than Boston or is lack of quality opponents a factor?  Does Vegas truly have a top defense or is goaltending saving them?  Do the Isles really have that bad an offense or is playing good defenses a factor?  Etc.  That can all be stated for every team so please bear that in mind.  When I say this is basic, I mean it, but it can be a starting point for a more advanced analysis, which I do plan to do once the playoffs are over and all data is in.

So here is GA and GF in the regular season and how they affect standings in the playoffs:

* 8 of 8 teams with better GA's are winning or have won their series
   * Colorado - 3rd in GA past St. Louis 19th in GA
   * Las Vegas - 1st in GA leading Minnesota 15th in GA
   * Toronto - 8th in GA leading Montreal 18th in GA
   * Winnipeg - 10th in GA past Edmonton 11th in GA
   * NYI - 2nd in GA leading Pittsburgh 13th in GA
   * Boston - 4th in GA past Washington 17th in GA
   * Carolina - 5th in GA leading Nashville 12th in GA
   * Tampa Bay - 6th in GA leading Florida 9th in GA

&amp;#x200B;

* 4 of 8 teams with better GF's are winning or have won their series

5808,nhl,"Good Morning,

The other day my friend and I made a podcast about the playoffs and this topic was brought up. Jordan Binnington is Taylor Swift in regard to career/player development.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**To get started lets take a look at why:**

&amp;#x200B;

[A serious conversation.](https://preview.redd.it/r2l01urkea171.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c978ee7ea81bda30f5b38980b7973b8aed98c0f0)

Jordan Binnington seems to have made a few transitions in his career. As has Taylor swift. These two mega-stars have been paralleling each-other and I think after this presentation you will agree with me that this is very true, as well as agree that the future is bright for Stanley Cup winning Goaltender Jordan Binnington.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 1: The Beginning of Stardom.**

&amp;#x200B;

[The Rookie and The Future.](https://preview.redd.it/gc65trthea171.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed78db5e5d771cd29b4c688afd3934664e5e22fc)

When Jordan Binnington started his career he was just like Taylor Swift in the beginning of her music career. As a rookie he had a lot of potential. Turning lots of heads and creating a lot of buzz. Everyone knew he was going to be a star. Just as Taylor had the same buzz around her and her music. Seasoned hockey players/musicians knew that if they played their cards right that they would be a mega star after a few years.  Both played to win while keeping their roots in tact and it showed with their gameplay/music. It wouldn't take long for both of these talented rookies to break into the Show/Starlight. And boy howdy did they. Which brings us to our next phase.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 2: The Breakout.**

&amp;#x200B;

[The Mega-Stars.](https://preview.redd.it/5jmxywffea171.png?width=1744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8896dc7d09e1f6db34e18a6dbe80e5b8a7bae22)

It was only a matter of time before these two broke out of their Rookie shells and indeed became the mega stars that they are now. Taylor quickly took her stardom and ran with it creating music that rocked the world with its lyrics, speaking to millions. The same goes for Jordan Binnington as be broke out of the minors and into The Show. With the Blues on his back he fought the St Louis Blues out of their bad first half of the season to not only make it to the playoffs, but win the entire damn thing. His Stanley Cup performance rocked the world with his gameplay and indeed also spoke to millions. This is the moment these stars were born for.

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know in Hollywood/Hockey you must adapt to stay relevant. Different styles of gameplay/music along with a change in demeanor can do wonders for career longevity. Hockey/Music is a mind game at times so they both had to make a drastic change. Which brings us to Phase 3.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 3: The Bad Boy/Girl.**

Binnington/Taylor had gone through some hardships in their rise to the top. People trying to get in their way, obstacles to overcome, what have you... Phase 3 is what I consider to be current Binnington which I like to call the ""Look what you made me do."" Phase.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Badness ensues.](https://preview.redd.it/rmmkusbcea171.png?width=1991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baea9f0fdd0f3b88aaaeecdd9161f0ff5c58d0d9)

&amp;#x200B;

This year Binnington had a chip on his shoulder. All season we talked on this subreddit about Binnington throwing ""punches"" at opposing players. Hes been playing like a man on fire with his goaltending and his wild ""punches"". The same was for Taylor. Kanye rushed the stage after her Grammy win over Beyonce and she wasn't going to take that lying down. She came out swinging with ""Look what you made me do"". A chip on her shoulder that could only be matched by a goaltender in St Louis a few years later.

In these playoffs Grubauer punched one of his teammates and Binnington, like T-Swift, decided that enough is enough.  He rushed Grubauer with a vengeance and had to be held back by the referees.

Lets look at these lyrics from the T-Swift song.

*I don't like your little games*

*Don't like your tilted stage*

*The role you made me play of the fool*

*No, I don't like you*

If that isn't directly related to Grubauer, I don't know what is. This is further driven home if you add his name after each line.

*I don't like your little games, Philipp Grubauer*

*Don't like your tilted stage, Philipp Grubauer*

*The role you made me play of the fool, Mr. Grubauer*

*No, I don't like you, Philipp*

&amp;#x200B;

Goosebumps.

&amp;#x200B;

With Taylor ahead of Jordan in this phase this begs the question...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Who knows?](https://preview.redd.it/eazq4uzaea171.png?width=2057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e132183ca1863bc9afcc46b8e5a962c1ff671d)

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at both careers this far we are in to deep to not wildly speculate what is next for Binnington. With how they have Paralleled eachother so far there is only one logical explanation on what will happen with our boy next.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 4: The Future.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Looking good.](https://preview.redd.it/mp2tx9k7ea171.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9bd1147ac436c66a7901a87b6a5f835dbeaa5c7)

&amp;#x200B;

The only logical next step for Jordan is to go into his Sexy Time Phase. Taylor ditched her good girl roots long ago, but wasn't done there. She transitioned yet again into a sexy starlet. With how the past has panned out, Binnington is soon to follow.

I can only assume that his goalie pants might be shorter next season to show off more upper thigh. His socks may turn into fishnet socks. His skates will have high heeled boots fixed to them. His helmet will have quaffed and teased blonde curly hair to distract opponents. He will hire equally as distracting/sexy backup dancers to sit in the seats behind the glass directly behind him to further distract his opponents and Pierre McGuire.

I, for one, am very excited for this career transition and truly hope that he continues to rock the world just as his career twin Taylor Swift does.

**The End.**

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, well done. You, like Binnington/T-Swift, are a trooper.

One would think that Seattle couldn't possibly be as competitive as Vegas right away, in the sense that general manager surely wouldn't let themselves be fleeced in the same ways.  I'm not necessarily expecting it, but it wouldn't surprise me.  A lot of things that benefited Vegas are going to benefit Seattle because of the last two years of cap crunch.  There should be some decent free agents, including franchise goaltending options, which in this scenario Seattle could hypothetically be the highest bidder for.

5923,nhl,"It‚Äôs 2021. We can pretend that we still live in the 90s and look away but enough is enough. With the hot mic episode with Tim Peel, it‚Äôs obvious that the refs have more control over the flow than they should. ‚ÄúCrappy‚Äù penalty after ‚Äúcrappy‚Äù penalty is called all season long. And then as soon as we enter post season, all the rules go out the window. What‚Äôs the point? I‚Äôve always hated it but now with the evidence, it needs to stop. Refs need to call games in the post season just like they do in the regular season. Slashes to wrists and back of legs all game long, along with cross checks to the lower back over and over again, is the reason these teams end up playing with half an NHL roster come Stanley Cup. My wife hates me for it but I don‚Äôt miss a single game of my favorite team all season long. So don‚Äôt come here pretending I‚Äôm some simp baseball fan that only watches playoff hockey. I‚Äôm 35, played organized hockey until I was 22, and now coach youth hockey.
